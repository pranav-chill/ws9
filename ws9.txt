As a Bible-believing evangelical Christian, I believe it to be extremely valuable to study and explore other faiths.  After being challenged by a Mormon friend to further explore their doctrine, I purchased this book.  Ironically, even though the Mormon church states that the BOOK OF MORMON contains the \"fullness of the everlasting gospel\", you'll find many contradictions to the Book of Mormon and Biblical theology in \"Mormon Doctrine\" and other 'sacred' Mormon writings and teachings.  <br />I believe that God was always God and that Christ is His ONLY begotten son, that He is not married, does not have a body of flesh and bones and as He is now He has forever been and always will be.  This book helped me to see that the complexities involved in the Mormon religion are simply beyond reason, and I am thankful that this resource is available to show Mormons where the contradictions within their religion lie.  I also found it interesting to note the different definitions that Mormons use for the same \"jargon\" we use in the Christian world.  Most notable was \"atonement\" ... interesting. <br />God bless any Christian who reads this book in order to more effectively discuss what matters most with their Mormon friends.  May we all always \"speak the truth in love.\"  Jesus loves you and He died for you ...	2005-10-14

WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM.

But this book is heartfelt, and I feel really touched the essence of the person that Anthony Radziwill was.  I happen to have known him in freshman and sophmore year at Boston University. In freshman year he was in all of my classes. Some mornings I would have coffee and a muffin with him in the coffee shop next to our building, I had no clue who he was other than another BU student hoping to get good grades. He was the most unassuming normal down to earth person you would ever want know. He did have a sophisticated air about him but other than that he was like the rest of us in most ways trying to make our way in life. She knew the 'real' person, and he was conveyed in her book. She obviously had a 'real' relationship with John and Carolyn also. We on the outside only see what we read and hear about in the tabloids - we don't have a real picture of these people. Its a shame that some people are saying Ms. Radziwill is trying to benefit from her name by marriage. She lost her husband, the love of her life, I would think she is using this book as a sort of therapy to help her through what I'm sure have not been an easy six years.  This book made me realize that the time we have with our most loved and dearest may be short, so enjoy them and cherish them now.	2005-10-13

The book presents Jesus in a non-threatening way.  Jesus cares for the protagonist in a personal way as he explains who he is and why he is the most important person in history.  Jesus rebuts a few attacks related to other religions and not forcing himself on us.  All this through a dinner conversation.  In the end, the book is a good evangelistic tool that presents Jesus in his fullness, but more of a loving warm fuzzy than a judgmental hammer.  I liked it so much that I ordered five copies to give away to searching friends. <br />Basically, a lite read as well.  And the author has much the same gift that Rick Warren shows in \"Purpose Driven Life\", in that he takes complicated principles and simplifies them down to easy-to-understand truths without any dilution of meaning.  You'll love it, whether you are a Christian (any denomination) or not.	2005-10-13
US	52806429	R1S26TVRC92X4A	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	4	7	14	N	N	It's a good thing the new media wasn't around back then	The current war in Iraq is being played out in living color on 24-hour cable news channels, analyzed ad nauseam on talk radio, and reported in not-always-accurate detail via a plethora of websites. While balanced perspectives are available to those proficient enough to wade through the stormy seas of coverage, much of the reporting obsesses on the drawbacks and any failed efforts of the US military and its allies.  <br /> It is a very good thing that such myriad media did not exist in 1776.  In David McCullough's engaging rendering of America's birth, he exposes the many setbacks, missteps, defeats, desertions, and poorly planned or executed campaigns that plagued the nascent nation's ragged army. Had CNN existed in those days, a colonial version of Judy Woodruff could regularly regale viewers with leading statements such as \"more and more of General Washington's supporters are growing disillusioned with his poor management and indeciveness.\"   An 18th century Al Franken could have gone on Air America (a.k.a. Err America) and maligned the American military for declaring war on a sovereign country that posed it no threat.  And an equally vacuous, previous incarnation of Arianna Huffington would have had reason to have elite loyalists malign Washington and company on a reality-blurring blog had such technology been around during the Revolution. <br /> McCullough does document the miscalculations America's inexperienced military committed as well as list the many triumphs of the established and potent British forces.  He expounds upon the doubts many of Washington's contemporaries privately and sometimes publicly expressed.  Before the sober judgment of history could objectively evaluate the transfiguring legacy of Washington's accomplishments, the uncertainty of the present did give jusifiable cause to those who questioned his wisdom and strategy.   The eventual success of the ragtag colonial army-despite massive desertions-and the enduring American experiment prove the mastery of Washington's prowess and show why his name has become synonymous with greatness. The Father of his Country would not have earned his rightful place in history had he failed to remain steadfast when the going got tough or adroitly recovered from the inevitable mistakes that befall all battlefield planning. <br /> \"1776\" fleshes out a timeless story and shows that there were many difficulties and heartaches that preceded the ultimate victory.  It also serves as a good inspiration for the ongoing liberation of Iraq.  Had the clichs of \"quagmire\" and \"another Vietnam\" existed in the 1700's no doubt the ancestors of today's antiwar ilk would have routinely invoked them.  As this readable work clearly spells out, war is a messy proposition where the best laid plans can and do go astray, but setbacks can never excuse retreat.  A far stronger case could have been made for abandoning the mission in 1776 than modern day Iraq.  Years from now both will stand as American military victories, and the bumps along the road to success will be reduced to historic footnotes.  <br />	2005-10-13

US	34852280	R2BJ19ANBBF3X5	0387983740	737069480	The Physics of Musical Instruments	Books	5	38	38	N	N	The best reference work under this title.	This is the long-awaited second edition of Fletcher & Rossing.  Note first that it really is a reference work, not a teaching text.  There is no lesson plan, no problems, no solutions manual, no accompanying workbook  Except for the first two foundation sections on vibrating systems and sound waves, there is no ongoing development.  Nothing builds.  It's just one topic piled on another.   <br />       But the great merit of reference works is that you can cherry-pick, i.e. seek information on isolated topics with little concern for what preceded them.  As a reference work, F&R get the highest possible marks from me.  They are clearly the masters of this field, not least because of their numerous important contributions to it.  With the possible exception of the works of Arthur Benade, they own the business.   <br />       Despite its enormous size and great depth of coverage, however, it is not an encyclopedic study of musical instruments.  It is exactly what the title says: a work on the PHYSICS of musical instruments.  A rigid boundary has been drawn between physics and every other aspect of music-making.  In particular, psychoacoustics is totally ignored.  There are no entries in the index under loudness, Fletcher-Munson, combination tones, false bass, consonance, dissonance, etc.  Even equal temperament tuning gets little more than one page out of 756. <br />       The Preface says the work is addressed to \"the reader...who is not frightened by a little mathematics.\"  Well, some of the math is \"little\" but some of it is not.  See for example the use of Green's functions to find the air load on a vibrating membrane, pp. 588-590.  Perhaps at MIT, where incoming freshman are sorted out by the do-or-die killer course in mathematical physics from Morse & Feshbach, these methods are taught to undergrads, but not at most other schools.  Almost everywhere else this would be considered first-year graduate material.  These pages would not only frighten the averagereader; they frighten me.  I always hated Green's functions and considered it part of my mission in life to prune them away wherever they grew. <br />     There are a few typos, mislabeled equations and the like.  The next-to-last sentence of text on p. 232 says, \"This is an adquate approximation provided the sound wavelength is small compared to the transverse dimensions of the ducts and cavities involved.\"  Surely \"small\" should read \"large.\" <br />       In sum, not for beginners, and probably not for most musicians either.  But within its compass it reigns supreme.  There is no better book in this field.     <br />  <br />	2005-10-13

Bush was elected (actually appointed by the Supreme Court) in 2000 with the longest criminal rap sheet and the most opaque biography in American history.  Had Americans read (which most don't) Ms. Kelley's book, our country would not be in the dire straits we find ourselves today - bankrupt, reviled by the rest of the civilized world and environmentally degraded.  How George W. Bush, a cocaine addicted, alcoholic neer-do-well, who didn't have a real job before his 40th birthday, was somehow portrayed as being more honest and moral than Al Gore, is one of the great mysteries of the last century.  Read this book and learn how utterly corrupt, despicable and dysfunctional the Bush family really is.	2005-10-13

The episode is so dramatic that one almost forgets that the paramount reason behind the rough treatment afforded to the recruits is to decondition their self-preservative reflexive actions for battle, while simultaneously making them tough enough and hard enough to be still standing at the end of the day. ONE BULLET AWAY: The Making of a Marine Officer, completes the circle, and thensome. <br /> <br />Author Nathaniel Fick is among the best of the best, a former captain in the United States Marine Corps First Recon Battalion. ONE BULLET AWAY is Fick's unflinching account of his recruitment into the Marines, his advancement, and his service on the fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq. He gives the reader an up-close and personal view of what it is like to be a soldier. One element of military training that is often lost upon the layman is the importance of the history of warfare and of soldiering; as Fick notes here, marines learn from the mistakes of those who have gone ahead. Every marine accordingly has an obligation to ensure that the sacrifices of those who have preceded them are not in vain. <br /> <br />Fick's account of his role in modern warfare, which constitutes the balance of the book, is anecdotal at its most interesting, ranging from accounts of bravery, courage, and compassion to the occasional stupidity of commanders for whom the battlefield is more of a concept than reality. One comes away from this memoir with the feeling that, as with most things, it is miraculous when any project proceeds to completion successfully. In ONE BULLET AWAY, however, the stakes are much higher. <br /> <br />Fick elected to forego re-upping with the Marines, an understandable decision considering the events recounted here and their personal aftermath for him. ONEBULLET AWAY is a highly readable, personal memoir that rings and resonates with bravery, clarity and truth. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub	2005-10-13

As I read a few sentences in each expostion of certain stories, I automatically would HAVE to continue reading, and evventually, the story would take me onto the next story. Hearing about \"real world\" examples, made me feel like not such a fool, if it had happened to me before.These short stories provide us, meaning teenagers, the oppurtunity to listen to others are age, and what they have to say. The author's actually have the guts to express and let other's read these life changing stories, so it'd be nice if they were good for something. Throughout the book, there are numerous stories in each sections. The Sections include, friendship, relationships, the power of love, family, lessons, tough stuff, overcoming obstacles, self-discovery and growing up. All of these topics are vital to teenage lives. So many things are bound to happen during what most people call these \"rough\" years, which would mean teenage years. The protagonist in these stories are the author's who reveal life secrets when they've been through something rough, or good. It gives us the oppurunity to reflect on life, love and learning. As a teenager, we go through so much, by reading the Chicken Soup books, it puts us in the position to deal with life, and realize others go through dramatic times as well. The themes of this book is life, love, and learning. Many stories were tear jearkers, yet some would give me the giggles. Honestly, this isn't one of those \"fake books that the author just makes up a bunch of stories about the lives of teenagers.\" It's a book where real teenagers pour their hearts out, so other's can listen to what they go through.

Liungman's explanations of their origin and uses. Browsing the pages is rewarding for the artist looking for inspiration. There is plenty of it -- the book contains some 1,600 articles, and an additional 100 pages with essays on ubiquitous/especially interesting signs or sign systems (such as the Mystical Pentagram, or the signs of the Alchemists). <br /> <br />The explanations are usually to the point, although I find that Liungman occasionally strays too far away from the subject at hand. The sections about the astrological systems of signs are particularly abundant in information, and would have gained from being more carefully edited. The selection of signs, however, is excellent; it even includes modern ideograms from the Internet age, such as the At sign. <br /> <br />Symbols -- Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms really excels when it comes to searching for signs that the reader does not yet know the name of. Using a taxonomy scheme of his own, Liungman has classified the signs into 54 distinctive groups. The reader can navigate to any of the groups simply by describing the sign in terms of \"Crossing lines/Not crossing lines\", \"Single-axis symmetric/Asymmetric\" and so on. A quick glance at the right group overview page is all it takes to find the right match. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended.	2005-10-13

In this world, things cannot be resolved with a simple wave of a hand.

I did not have the feeling that I had to turn to the next page to see what was happening. <br /> <br />The book follows Rayford starting at age 9 determined to be an airline pilot or a professional athlete. And ends with him as the Airline Pilot we meet in the series. He was a very good athlete in school, but things kept happening to make him just not good enough in any of the sports he played to gain an athletic scholarship. So he accepts an ROTC one. He also accomplishes his goal of a private pilots license before high school graduation.  Though some of the insights he has are a little too mature for the age he has them. <br /> <br />The more interesting story is that of Nicolae Carpathia the Antichrist. And what transpire in order to pick the correct mother and father. And how much of that conspiracy the mother knew nothing about. Nicolae's conception, birth and schooling are covered. And we follow him up to the time where he was returned from his 40 days in the desert. The intelligence and lack of compassion in the boy is truly scary. <br />	2005-10-12

King Alfred ruled Wessex, England 871-899.  His country was in a deplorable educational decline--old monks died before teaching the younger monks how to read Latin, and so a great many works were lost to illiteracy.  England had fallen into a chasm of bitter feuding between warlords after the Romans left in 410.  But most pressingly--the Danes attacked at their leisure--by the thousands--pillaging, raping, and burning.  After his three brothers had succeeded to the throne, and each was killed in battle, Alfred suddenly found himself wearing the crown, commanding a kingdom battered by seemingly inexhaustible enemies and mired in despair.  His resources were terribly low, monetary and otherwise, and yet King Alfred and his loyal army (and navy) won enough battles to force the Danes to make peace--and he even converted the pagan King Guthrum to Christianity.  King Alfred recruited scholars from the continent, he was friends with the grandchildren of Charlemagne, he exhorted his noblemen to read books, he erected forts at strategic points all across the boundaries of Wessex, and he is generally acknowledged as the father of the British Navy.  The man was nothing short of genius.<br /><br />Douglas Woodruff's book brings King Alfred back to life:  The events of his father's reign, the circumstances of Alfred's ascent to the throne, the sense of patriotism he instilled in his subjects, and the after-effects of Alfred's commitment to God and Country--the man's spirit echoed for centuries.  Indeed, England celebrated the 1,000-year anniversaries of both Alfred's birth and death.<br /><br />The author includes maps of Anglo-Saxon England, Anglo-Saxon paintings and drawings, photos of Anglo-Saxon (and Dane) armor, photos of gargantuan drawings carved into hillsides commemorating Alfred's victories (which still exist today), and even photos of Anglo-Saxon jewelry and coins.<br /><br />For either the novice, or the seasoned student of English history, this book will fascinate.history, this book will fascinate.	2005-10-12

It is clearly organized in 6 chapters, plus an introduction and a conclusion, and you can find useful information about most of the narratives that are part of the cannon of Spanish American fiction.  In that sense, it is not a revolutionary or innovative work, and owes a lot to the previous research by scholars such as John Brushwood, although Lindstrom incorporates recent scholarship as well in her work.  That's the only reason I do not give it 5 stars.

This book is funny; I mean REALLY funny. Tim Bete is the Dave Barry for parents of young kids, so if you like to laugh, then you'll love reading this one.<br /><br />In fact, my family could tell whenever I was reading it because they'd hear my annoying, \"HA! HA! HA!\" from every room of the house. I couldn't put it down because it felt so good to laugh. I've decided it's a much easier route to six-pack abs than sit-ups. Just read this book and you'll get a major abdominal workout!<br /><br />IN THE BEGINNING...THERE WERE NO DIAPERS is divided into 19 short chapters that each focus on one area of parenting young children. With titles such as, \"The Miraculous World of Potty Training,\" \"Five Loaves, Two Fish -- What, No Tarter Sauce?\" and \"Daddy's NOT going to Buy You a Mockingbird,\" you can get an idea of how funny Bete is.<br /><br />Laughter is important for stressed-out parents. We may feel like we're the only one dealing with certain behavior issues -- single parents, especially, may have no one who can share the burden. But a book like this one helps fill in the gaps.<br /><br />This would make a great gift for any Dad - but I know moms will love it too. Bete lets you peek into his house and show you how he turns those moments of \"Uh-oh\" (the tooth fairy forgot to visit...) into moments of \"Ah-ha! Close your eyes and she'll leave you a surprise\" (It may even be money...or other unknown contents from a rapidly emptied pocket!)<br /><br />I can't tell you how hard I laughed when Tim described what it's like to change a baby's diaper in an airplane bathroom.

It sounded interesting and I thought I'd give it a try.  This book was AMAZING.  The story is so original, and the way it mixed futuristic with the past was so cool.  I really enjoyed how they viewed our world - everything there is so advanced that they see what we did and what we have as insane.  This book allows you to realize that everybody looks good in their own right.  I personally hate my nose, but after reading this book I'm more \"Ok, my nose is me.\"  The length may deter some, but it's a fast read and very well written.  Now I just have to wait for my local library to get \"Pretties\" in so I can read that one. :)	2005-10-12

However, I recently traveled to the Valais region (SW of Switzerland) and found really very little in the way of useful information from this book. <br /> <br />As an example, on of the smaller, rural valleys in the region called Val d'Herens had a single paragraph including a sentence that said the valley was not to be missed, but nothing on why or what to see.  The valley was filled with charming towns like Evolene and beautiful villages (personally, I recommend the village of Arolla at the head of the valley for beautiful hiking). <br /> <br />I did not visit any major areas besides Zermatt that were well covered by the book, but perhaps if your trip revolves around cities of good size, this is the right book for you.  For those seeking an overall country guide, this book does not provide a good enough level of detail.	2005-10-12

Starmore is a great knitting historian, and those two books mentioned are incredible resources for traditional work.<br /><br />Even this book of men's sweaters has a few nice traditional patterns that would be good for any era.  The traditional gansey that opens the book is one of these.<br /><br />However, I was quite shocked at how dated many of the patterns are in this book. As a man, I can say that in the whole book there were maybe only 2-3 sweaters I would ever be caught dead in.  My wife was more or less laughing at many of the designs.  Obviously each to their own, but be warned that this is not like Starmore's other books of 'timeless' classics.<br /><br />Also disappointing is that the book is mostly just patterns.  Alice Starmore's best stuff -- her instructional writing and knitting history writing -- is not present in this book, making it significantly less interesting than the previously mentioned Fair Isle and Aran Island books.<br /><br />It is cheaper than other Starmore books, but the lower price reflects an inferior product.  Maybe the patterns will be enough for some, but for me, if I am going to spend so much for an out of print book, I want more than just a few good patterns.<br /><br />UPDATE (2/2/2012): The price for a used copy of this book has dropped considerably since I first wrote the review.  The current price of $18, is a pretty reasonable price when you consider that there are at least 2 quality patterns in this book. At the time I wrote the original review, the price was more than $50, which IS too much considering that the majority of the patterns are not up to Starmore's usual quality level.	2005-10-12

She tells the distressing story of what is was like to raise her daughter Nancy and watch her disintegrate before her eyes while she had to stand back after the medical community failed them both terribly.  Nancy Spungen was eighties punk rock icon Sid Vicious' girlfriend.  Their tumultuous rock and roll romance ended abruptly when he stabbed her to death in New York's Chelsea Hotel.  Nancy's life was a personal hell for herself and her mother and only became public when Nancy became involved with Sid.  Sid was lead singer for the Sex Pistols who in spite of only putting out two albums and performing less than fifty times became a legendary band whose name is known far and wide even outside the punk community.   <br /> <br />     Nancy was a mentally exhausting infant and toddler because she screamed incessantly for reasons no doctors ever found.  She had an above average intelligence level once reaching school age and the reasons for her anguish were never fully revealed.  Doctor's only answers for Nancy's problems were to over medicate her which led Nancy to the hellish existence of a heroin addict.  Nancy met Sid when he was early in his fame and turned him onto the drug heroin then the two spent years shooting up, getting clean, falling off the wagon, and making a name for themselves in their highly unstable lives.   <br /> <br />     Deborah Spungen reveals very private tragedy's that occurred as a result of her daughter's draining pull on the family.  Things like affairs, extreme sibling rivalry, and a constant flow of money going to institutions and psychiatric centers in desperate attempts to rehabilitate Nancy are just the tip of the iceberg of the problems caused by having a daughter like Nancy.  I could feel Deborah's anguish in every line written in spite of being initially unsure of whether or not a mother could give an honest account of a daughter's life.  I camefrom a strict home life and later because a drug addict (sober 8 years now) and can't imagine the book my mom would write about raising me.  I was sure Deborah would place the blame on Nancy and make herself out to be a saint or at least spend the entire book as a martyr but no such thing occurred.   The only blame placed was on the medical community for failing to try to do anything for the young Nancy and on Deborah by herself for not pushing harder and questioning doctors more.  Although I think she went above and beyond her duty to find help for her baby.   <br />     Deborah leaps into new memoir territory telling Nancy's story, her own, and her families to help us dissect, understand, and hopefully learn from their tragedy.  Deborah commands us to listen and forces us to see the soft white underbelly of Nancy's life which was painful, sad, and hopeless right from the beginning much different then what you would know of Nancy reading anything else about her at the time of the murders or since then.  This American nightmare is a must read for mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers, fathers, punk rockers, addicts, and mostly physicians in a hope that next time they will do more then poo poo a concerned mother.	2005-10-12

It is difficult now to appreciate both how audacious an undertaking it represents, and how astonishing its immediate and continued success was.  Over the course of twelve books Milton wrote an epic poem that would ''justify the ways of God to men,'' a mission that required a complex drama whose source is both historical and deeply personal.  The struggle for ascendancy between God and Satan is played out across hell, heaven, and earth but the consequences of the Fall are all too humanly tragic--pride, ambition, and aspiration the motivating forces.'  In this new edition derived from their Oxford Authors text, Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg discuss the complexity of Milton's poem in a new introduction, and on-page notes explain its language and allusions.\"	2005-10-12

The premise is both simple to understand and quite intriguing.  A man has lost his knowledge of his self and his life, but continues to remember the things that he has read and seen that do not actually relate to him.  If yesterday he sat down with his wife and ate breakfast while watching the news, then it would be the news alone that is in his head today. <br /> <br />Starting off in this way, the novel appears to be a sort of coming of age again novel.  An exploration of self, unbiased by actually having lived the life and seeing it from your side.  A great gate is opened in the opening of this book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately after the gates swings open the main character does not charge through to the awaiting world, but merely leans against said gate.  It really is a shame. <br /> <br />The story consists almost entirely of a man, alone, going through the children items collected in his late parents' attic.  And, as the character goes through these things there is a brief narrative of what was happening as these items came into being.   <br /> <br />There are definately interesting parts in this wanderings, but in the end they turn out to be simply wandering.  There is really no tying together at the end or any great message derived from any of the pieces of the old life that he finds.   <br /> <br />In the end Umberto teaches us a lesson from the Bible.  Do not sew together an old cloak with new patches.  The fabric stretches and wears in different directions and the whole is only made more severe. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

The holocaust and the atrocities that were inflicted on the Jewish people were so horrendous that I hesitated, not wanting to be depressed.  The book sat at my bedside for months, before I finally picked it up to read.  What was I thinking?  This was Jerry Spinelli and he didn't let me down.  The book opens with an orphan who finds himself in Warsaw Germany trying to stay alive amongst the chaos on the streets of 1939. They call him \"Stop! Thief!\", \"Gypsy\", \"Filthy son of Abraham\".  Orphaned too young to remember his real name, a friend names him, Misha.  The first eleven pages paint a vidid picture of Misha running, darting around the soldiers and slipping between the jackboots.  I found myself rushing and dashing through the pages the same way Misha was doing in the book.  Milkweed is not a depressing book, in fact it is very uplifting.  Of course, you see and live the torturous times and share a tear or two with the characters, but you experience how even in the worst of times, glimmers of happiness shine through; thus the title for the book.  Even with hope waning, despair everywhere, a milkweed grows through a crack in the dirty street, symbolizing how the human spirit endures.  What I love about all of Jerry's books is how he blends the problems (usually a boy) his protagonist faces with the impish thoughts and feelings of every boy in his characters.  \"Snips and snails, and puppy dog tails, that's what little boys are made of,\" and Jerry never misses that aspect in his characters.  Even while writing about this dark subject, the things we love about little boys show through.  This book won the Golden Kite Award and is a great book to help children learn about that grim period of time, while inspiring them to read. - Reviewer for The Best Book Bin	2005-10-12

It's worse than his previous worst novel, Ancient Evenings, which single-handedly turned me off for years on all things Egyptian.<br /><br />No, I'm not some outraged evangelical railing at someone making use of \"My Lord `n Savior,\" I think Jesus is fair game and a fine topic for literature and speculation. But I'm not going to do as so many others seem willing to and automatically bestow praise on a book merely because it takes the sacred Jesus and casts him into the harsh light of modern judgment. In The Gospel According To The Son, Norman Mailer, proponent of the \"non-fiction novel\" (figure that one out) manages to make a good story dull and argumentative, drains all color and life from the plot, and delivers something that is SO dead on arrival it's unrecognizable as the tale of Jesus: a biography already filled with drama, betrayal, false arrest, torture, execution, and all the raw material of a gripping story. I've got to hand it to Mailer, not everyone could take a story ready-made for adaptation, all-but handed to him on a silver platter like the head of Saint John the Baptist, and then smash it down to third-rate nonsense. Here even the Devil was boring and it takes A LOT to ruin the best villain ever created. Mailer seemed to want to absent all vestiges of Christ from this little re-telling of the life of the historical man, Jesus of Nazareth, and I can actually respect that, but in rendering this material so skeptically humanistic as to be bland beyond tolerance puzzles me. I can't say I laughed out loud at the truly bad jokes slipped in here and there amid the equally execrable prose, but the line about \"Peter was like a rock...he could be broken by a bigger rock...\" elicited a genuine chuckle that something so lame made it past an editor.<br /><br />Right after he released this work back in the late `90's, I heard the author on NPR saying, in essence, \"The Gospels are badly composed. There are many writers who could have written them better, and I am foremost among that number.\" Mailer's ego knows no bounds and his trash talking was a little endearing. I just wish he was able to back it all up with a better book than this.<br /><br />The bottom line is this book blows. Skip it in favor of The Last Temptation of Christ, or read a good translation of the four Gospels.d.

It's highly accessible and covers a lot of territory, more than any other introduction I've encountered. It's only drawback is its superficiality, as it doesn't fully cover probability, mathematical calculus, boolean logic, decision trees, or theorems and proofs..<br /><br />The book begins with the uses of language, fallacies, arguments in ordinary language, Venn Diagrams, and then proceeds to symbolic logic, Aristotlean and a cursory overview of predicate calculus, quantification, science and hypothesis, analogy and probability (especially Mill's four rules of causal inference), and concludes with logic and the law (as a practical example of the application of logic).<br /><br />This book would make an excellent text for an introduction to philosophical logic and arguments. There are definitely superior books that deal with each of the above subjects individually, but none that I know that covers such broad terrain in a short amount of space. As more and more colleges and universities mandate some course in critical thinking, I cannot think of a better text for an introductory overview. If this is the text, take the course.

I know that you were expecting me to come up with the name of the poll I saw that showed John Kerry was still behind George Bush in popularity by a 75/25 ratio, but isn't it enough that I keep telling you I saw it ???  Why not??? It's not like I could just look at some of the reputable polling sites for this info.      Well, I guess I could, but so far I only see the Sept. 6-7, 2005, Zogby America nationwide survey of 1157 randomly chosen likely voters, showing that even after all this time, Kerry would come within 1 percent of my Shrubbie at 47% to 48%, and worse yet, my Shrubbie would lose to every single president since Carter (well, including Carter).   Well, we all know Zogby, despite being a real pollster, is just a big Communist-terrorist-drug dealer, but the trouble is, I just can't find anything that says different !!!   So I think you should take my patriotic Shrub-lovin' word for it instead!!!!  As my Shrubbie likes to say, just trust me !!!!   After all, I trust all my other phony screen names !!!!!

Explained below.. <br /> <br /> <br />This book is fairily basic and as such will be especially useful to those new to the 'game.' While it will be tedious for experienced market participants to brush through explainations of what a moving average is, etc--I believe we can all learn something from the straight-forward TA employed by Stan Weinstein. For example, you wont see Elliot Wave defended or charts with pitchforks drawn on them--but rather a focus on moving averages (the simple logic being that MAs cut through volatility to give a better idea of the trend,) a top-down approach (i.e. Market --> Industry Group --> Security,) etc. <br /> <br />While I hold less faith than Stan in breakout systems, it's presented here in a easy to understand manner with examples and answers to test how well you are following his instruction. This man is a good teacher, and reminds me of William O'Neil in the way he gets his ideas across. <br /> <br />Particularily useful--at least for me--were his half-dozen or so favorite indicators he gave for guessing the future trend of stock markets. <br /> <br />Stan also gives his view on when to take profit on an equity you own, when and how to cut losses, and position sizing: i.e., the other 3/4 of your investing success. <br /> <br />I don't pretend to know a lot--but from what I've seen in my short experience, there is a lot of nonsense and questionable ideas used by some people under the TA banner, but Stan focuses on the simple, logical, common sense anaylsis. Being sophisticated--rather than demanding common sense--in many things in life including TA I believe causes more trouble than good; people want to believe they can figure something out and often vainly connect sophistry with (investor) wisdom.	2005-10-11

Stephen Green-Armytage, Extraordinary Chickens (Abrams, 2000)<br /><br />I still have no idea what to say about this book. I'm sure most people didn't see it the way I did, but I really couldn't help myself. Chickens are low-level disturbance generators to me, far below the level of clowns, but more disturbing than, say, mimes (who are simply annoying rather than the stuff of nightmares). For some reason, I was rather expecting your basic book of photos of chickens doing really dumb things. This is not that book.<br /><br />Green-Armytage obviously has an affinity for these fowl. (Which makes me wonder about him.) These are portraits of various show chickens, along with notes on the various breeds and that sort of thing. I ended up looking at it rather like I look at dog shows. Half the time, I'm wondering who it was that thought breed X was actually attractive, when it actually is the kind of thing that invokes nightmares in small children. The other half of the time, I was amazed that you can find this sort of thing in nature.<br /><br />The photos themselves are impeccable. Green-Armytage knows his way around a camera, to be sure. And if you're a fan of chickens in their more interesting forms, you will probably quite enjoy this. If, on the other hand, you think chickens are the harbingers of the end of the universe, you will most likely want to avoid this. ***	2005-10-11

This is not so much a book of particular things to do as it is a change of point of view, according to author Richard Wincor.  Wincor is a self-described 'average player', although it is obvious that he is better than that (however, Wincor's name is absent from the major lists of players, so while he may be above average, he did attain the master level ranking).<br /><br />This is not in fact a book for beginners, or perhaps even average players.  It involves strategy and tactics that Wincor describes with little definition to the terminology he uses.  This can be confusing to the novice who is unfamiliar with chess writing, so this is perhaps a good second or third book, but not a good first.  Besides, perhaps one should learn the game along the more traditional lines before one goes for broke through the baroque.<br /><br />Wincor's style of writing is fun and interesting to read.  He would identify with the second section in Edward Lasker's book, 'Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood'.  However, for Wincor, obviously the 'blood' is fun!  He writes of the first opening he describes, 'The most aggressive Baroque opening for White is the Dutch Stonewall.  Its texture is solid, massive and pent-up, something like a bunching of heavy tanks.  When it rolls, it has a chance of flattening all opposition in the King's fortress.'<br /><br />Wincor's commentary is inspired.  For example, in the same Dutch Stonewall game, he makes a comment after one interesting turn of play, 'Mrs. Bruce played that domestic tragedy like an Amazon.'  Wincor, upon speculating on the question of whether or not there is such a thing as a perfect opening, draws in ideas from Neoplatonists and quotes the poet Pope (yet hastens to add that Pope never thought of chess as an application of his verse).<br /><br />Wincor does not promise in this book that the novice will begin winning in grand-master tournaments.  However, he states, 'Still they lose, but with more style than before.'<br /><br />This is a very fun book.).   <br /> <br />Wincor does not promise in this book that the novice will begin winning in grand-master tournaments.

Back then in the 1930s, blacks were treated badly just for the color of their skin. Nobody cared about them. As for the whites, some found it hard to live that kind of lifestyle, just like the main characters, Jem and Scout, two siblings living at this time. They live in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. The town seems very boring and desolate. It also seems like they are stuck in a bubble, not able to get out of the town. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by a young girl named Scout who lives during the time when blacks and whites were segregated. Her father is a lawyer and he is often made fun of because he defends black people. Later in the book, he has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is charged for the crime of rape of a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. <br /> <br />Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout. He raises him with their cook, Calpurnia. Atticus teaches Scout everything. He tells her, \"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.\" She remembers this especially in the end of the book. Atticus says a lot of important things such as \"There's a lot of ugly things in this world, son. I wish I could keep 'em all away from you. That's never possible.\" He really cares about his children and he wants them to grow up right. <br /> <br />One summer, Jem and Scout meet their next door neighbor's nephew, Dill, who comes over every summer. They become amused with the house down the street, the Radley's. They want to see the son who is believed to have stabbed his father with scissors, Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. They have a silent relationship with Boo because of the presents Boo gives them in the knothole of a tree near the Radley house. The presents that he gave them included chewed up gum and figures that looked like them. It was really odd. <br /> <br />When I finished the book and took time to understand the meaning of why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird it all came to me and I liked the book. The book very harsh with racial discrimination, but it is really funny that the children of Maycomb County care more about the blacks than the adults. There are some fun and interesting parts besides the harsh comments, but mainly it focuses on how the past really was. I am still very happy to have been born in the time that I was. You must read this book because it will make you understand the past a little bit better and you will learn from the mistakes people back then made.	2005-10-11

I can identify with all you rabid Stephen King fans out there, as I am one myself. Most of you would agree that the master of horror couldn't write something uninteresting if he tried. This book has few bright spots however, and none of the \"I can't put this book down\" feel that is common to most of Mr. King's work. It is short enough that readers should make it through to the end, but what is waiting there to reward them is no prize. Mr. King's popularity sets him into a unique place. He can publish anything, and book sellers and loyal fans will eat it up. Because of this, I think he is toying with his readers, as an experiment. What he hopes to learn by this experiment is beyond me, and I am not happy to have been a part of it. Read this book if you feel you must, or if you have read everything he has ever written, but be warned, it is not up to his usual standard.	2005-10-10

I constantly hear people who have NEVER read it say things like, \"It's not good to cut out all carbs.\" or my personal favorite: \"You have to eat whole grains to get enough fiber.\"  Honestly, sometimes I really don't think that people realize that there is more fiber and nutrition in berries and spinach and way more of the omegas you need in meat and fish than there are in whole grains.  If you think about it, what do they feed farm animals to fatten them up for slaughter?  Answer: These animals are usually vegetarians that eat mostly corn, starches and grains.  Additionally, the other diets touting \"right kinds of carbs\" are just publishing the Atkins' maintenance phase and relabeling it.  Most diets that are considered \"reasonable\" and \"balanced\" encourage you to give up nutritional powerhouse foods due to high fat content, such as olives and avocados.  Considering that a serving of each of these foods could help more than they possibly hurt, how does that make any sense?   <br /> <br />Atkins really pioneered the recent changes we've seen on the diet end of the medical industry.  I also think it is interesting that the bankruptcy of the Atkins empire is considered the smoke signal that the low carb craze is over.  It really is just a signal that low carb processed foods are generally inferior in flavor and that eating naturally tastes better - which was the whole point to begin with.  In a way, it explains why most low carb manufacturers are sticking with the meal replacement shakes - sometimes we need something filling, fast, simple and chocolatey. <br /> <br />Once you change your eating habits to eating your favorite unprocessed meats, veggies and berries for 30 days and then change back to how you used to eat for a week or two, you will notice the difference in how you feel.  I found that fillers like bread on a sandwich or with a salad really replaced the nutrients I really would have been putting in my body by eating a few more vegetables or a few extra ounces of meat.  Thus, my old way of eating was not satisfying anymore.   <br /> <br />I know some people experience nausea or fatigue the first week or two and these are classic signs of withdrawal from any substance you've been depending on.  Granted, some don't react well with the higher animal fat content they are allowed to now eat, so therefore, they should probably stick with chicken and fish or add a couple more salads or cooked green vegetables (all carb limits aside, who EVER got fat off of unlimited green salads and non starchy vegetables?).	2005-10-10
US	52918976	R377YSDGZ8Y62O	1568360525	896804383	The Crossing Place: A Journey Among the Armenians (Kodansha Globe)	Books	2	9	9	N	N	too much Thesaurus, too little depth	This is a moderately disappointing book. Armenia has a fascinating history, multi-faceted, struggling against adversity and nevertheless producing talented, highly gifted people. So a good book would be necessary to do them justice.<br /><br />Philip Marsden tries to deliver this, and certainly undertook an effort. He learned Armenian, and traveled through 20 countries, tracing the history of this scattered people. However, as a reader you soon find that distance does not compensate for depth. It is all fairly breathless, a short night spent here, the next night in the next town, or next country. The experiences therefore remain fleeting, rarely reaching any level of insight. In fact, I think you can get pretty much the same information from a Lonely Planet guide, without the distracting personal details thrown in. This is not intrinsic, some of Marsden's other books actually are better in this regard.<br /><br />The style is fine, but since the substance is so thin, the chiseled descriptions end up being an irritating veneer, a writer straining his Thesaurus, rather than a good storyteller. There are occasional irritating elements: I, for one, no longer want to read about Western travelers turning down hookers in Eastern Europe, we have really heard it before and there is no need for the writer to parade his virtue to readers. It is, I should add, only a small irritation: overall, Marsden comes across as a likable person, which matters in travel writing, since you will follow private experiences.<br /><br />So, the book is best described as a broad survey of meeting Armenians in many countries, against the backdrop of the collapsing Soviet Union. Given the shortage of good books on Armenia, it may be a last resort. It may serve as a very basic introduction to Armenia. But otherwise, don't expect too much. If you know the region and like Armenia, the book will add little.<br /><br />I understand that some Armenians feel charmed by the attention, and therefore like the book. I sympathize, but I believe that their people would deserve more depth, and a more reflective understanding. At the same time, I also felt put off by the way Marsden approached Turkey. He essentially walks into Turkey feeling uneasy, and finds confirmation for his sentiments. No big surprise there, and little value added.e like the book.

There is however one sense in which it could be said that the russellian magnum opus is The Principles of Mathematics, from here on TPM.<br /><br />  TPM is, arguably, the culmination in print of a long process of thought and concern, philosophically speaking, of Russell's intellectual preoccupations from his adolescence, youth and maturity with questions relating to the foundations of mathematics. Ever since Russell read Mill in his adolescence he had thought there was something suspect with the Millian view that mathematical knowledge is in some sense empirical &amp; that mathematics is, so to speak, the most abstract of empirical sciences, but empirical nonetheless. Though he lacked the sophistication at the time to propose a different philosophy of mathematics, his concerns with these topics remained with him well into the completion of Principia Mathematica. Logic and Mathematics were, by that time, seen as separate subjects dealing with distinct subject-matters; it came to be, however, the intuition of Russell (an intuition shared, and indeed, anticipated by Frege) that mathematics was nothing more than the later stages of logic. He did not come into this view easily; after a long period of Hegelianism and Kantianism in philosophy, in which Russell sought to overcome the so called antinomies of the infinite and the infinitesimal, etc; Russell saw light coming, not from the works of philosophers, but from the work of mathematicians working to introduce rigour into mathematics. Through the developments introduced by such mathematicians as Cantor and Dedekind Russell saw, or indeed thought he saw, that the difficulties in the notion of infinite and infinitesimal could be dealt with by solely mathematical methods, and it was through the continued development of formal logic by Peano and his followers that Russell saw the possibility of defining the notions of zero, number &amp; successor in purely logical terms. Before all of these developments and ideas were put together by Russell and developed into the philosophy of mathematics known as logicism, he made several sophisticated though unsuccesful attempts at questions having to do with the foundations of mathematics, one such attempt is his &quot;An Analysis of Mathematical Reasoning&quot; (now in the Collected Papers). In TPM all of these developments are taken together with the formal logic Russell was developing following the steps of Peano, indeed the TRUE foundations of mathematics are for Russell: the calculus of classes, the propositional calculus and the predicate calculus. Of course, for Russell, the notion of class is a purely logical notion which is defined intensionally, by the comprehension axiom, rather than extensionally, by the enumeration of its members. This means that a class can be determined solely by a property which all of its members share. For example, the property of being blue determines the class of all blue things. The view that every property determines a class is what leads to Russell's paradox (more on this below).<br /><br />  Indeed, the book not only presents these developments, argues for them and introduces the reader to the theoretical and philosophical edifice of formal logic, but also with these tools Russell delves in an exploration of all or most concepts relevant in the mathematics of the day. As promised, he shows that Peano's primitives in the Peano-Dedekind axioms: zero, number &amp; succesor, can be defined in purely logical terms (according to his view of logic which is not philosophically neutral). He gives a definition of cardinal number in terms of one-one relations betwen classes. Indeed, a cardinal number is just the number of a class of similar classes, that is, the number of a class is the class of all classes similar to the given class &amp; two classes are similar if and only if there is a one-one bijection beween their members. For instance, the number '2' is the class of all couples and the term 'couple' can be further analysed through quantification &amp; identity (thus the definition is not circular). With this, &amp; Peano's axioms, he gets the natural numbers &amp; shows that with the methods he proposes he can construct the whole of the real numbers, and that the concept of infinity can be dealt with through the set-theory of Cantor. Russell's theory of relations, a theory which made possible to deal with relations in formal logic as well as to refute the metaphysical views of Bradley and others, appears in the book. The problem of the unity of the proposition, as well as perennial difficulties in the philosophy of language, rear their heads. The chapter on &quot;The Philosophy of the Infinite&quot; is a tour de force for anyone interested in the philosophy of mathematics. Zeno's paradoxes are discussed with the new methods, yielding valuable insights. Russell even engages in a brief, yet sophisticated, discussion of the philosophy of matter towards the end of the book.<br /><br />  This book is quite long, but it is absolutely breathtaking in its depth, its subtle arguments, its sophistication and originality (for its time). The book already contains a philosophy of language and reference not all that different from that of Frege in &quot;Sense and Reference&quot;, though less sophisticated, still capable on its own of dealing with definite &amp; indefinite descriptions via the use of the denoting concept (this gives the theory enough resources to deal w both impossible &amp; non-existent objects). As I said, it is thorough in its philosophical examination and explanation of mathematical concepts, and it delves into physics through the russellian investigation of space and time, as well as his incorporation of logicism into physics through rational dynamics.<br /><br />  Russell's paradox makes its first appeareance in this book, it has a chapter to itself. Given Russell's assumption that every property determines a class, one might ask, what of the property of not being a member of itself, a property which some classes have, like the class of humans, it is not a human &amp; therefore not a member of itself. But then, what of the class of all those classes which are not members of themselves? If the class is a member of itself, then it is not. But if it is not, then it is, the class is a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. This paradox puts the entire philosophical project at risk, Frege would respond to it by saying that the only possible foundation of mathematics has been shattered. Indeed, a sketch of Russell's theory of types, his eventual solution to the paradox, also makes an appearance in one of the books appendix's.<br /><br />  It is well known that Russell and Frege each came to his views independently, and indeed Russell had just read Frege by the time his book had been finished and so added another appendix discussing and commending Frege's work. Probably the first philosophical discussion of Frege's work in the English-speaking world.<br /><br />  All in all, this book is worth every penny, it is one of the masterpieces of XXth century philosophy by any standards. One professor of mine once remarked that if Russell had developed his famous theory of descriptions by the time he wrote TPM and had included it in the book, the already masterpiece would then be wholly perfect, I am inclined to agree.l classes similar to the given class &amp; two classes are similar if and only if there is a one-one bijection beween their members.

I read a book to my granddaughter, Aurora, yesterday...one a dear friend had sent me... i read it to her mainly because she had 1st grade homework which included reading time...since we had her with us, it was my pleasure to sit and read to her. We hadn't done it in awhile..and she used to love love love to have me read to her..now, being a big girl 6 she loves to do other things.  <br /> <br />The book is very sweet titled: \"I Wanna Go to Grandma's House\"  <br /> <br />The book goes along nicely sort of like a poem..rhyming words here and there.. real cute. The little girl in story is about Aurora's age and the grandma is 5 yrs older than i am...lol.  <br /> <br />Anywho, at a point in the book, the grandma talks of the granddaughter being an angel..and, in fact, at times she can see the lil girl's HALO. As i read this, Aurora stopped me and asked me what a halo was...as i explained it to her w/ motioning in circular pattern over her head she said:  <br />\"You mean like the one i see around Nick's head?....\" me: \"you see one around Nick's head?\" Aurora: \"Yes, only it has a big rock on his head\"...  <br /> <br />I let it go and later as we sat talking about something else i brought the subject up again as i was REALLY curious what she was talking about....(to say the least!)  <br /> <br />She explained to me in detail...that the halo around Nick's head had a beautiful rock on front of it and when she see's him (don't YOU see him grandma????!)...he's got it on his head..it's beautiful...and Nick always looks happy and is smiling at Aurora or waving at her. She went on to tell me she sometimes see's him in her dreams and they have fun and laugh and play...other times, she see's him in the daylight....:*)***....don't you, grandma????..... I told her no and she asked why.......i told her sometimes children can see things adults can't see and sometimes some adults can see them, too..but not always... no, i can't see him..i wish i could...  <br /> <br />You see, my son, Aurora's Uncle Nick, died in mid-August... I am forever grateful my friend, Rosemary, chose this book to send for us as we probably never would have had this conversation otherwise.  Of course, it is immensely comforting to me and a story I will never forget. Ever.	2005-10-10

What immediately struck me is that this book is not chopped into neat little portions that make the other Vonnegut books so easy to digest. Also, the chronology of the book follows a conventional time line of events that Vonnegut seems to avoid in his later books. Besides that, this is wild science fiction. America has been taken over by a computer and everyone has an employee rating based, predominately, on an IQ score. Engineers and executives rule the corporate world as most jobs have become automated. Engineers have become great by making other people's jobs obsolete. The corporate workers don't see what they are doing. For example, when one of the company's long-standing and self-important secretaries (with a Ph.D. - many people in this futuristic setting have been made to get PhDs) is told her job is not necessary because a computer can do it; she becomes upset and can't understand why anyone would tell her that her job wasn't necessary.<br /><br />This crazy culture is oddly observed by Shah of Bratpuhr who hails from an obscure but rich, unindustrialized society. The Shah prays and cajoles the computer to answers his riddles about the meaning of life, but it can't. The shah, despite admonishments by his tour guides, perceives all humans in the society to be \"slaves.\"<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is the Executive team building camp. Complete with adulterous affairs, roaring team anthems and silly adult competitiveness, the setting nails corporate suck-ups and purveyors of the corporate line. But watch out, the ghost shirt society is out to change it all!	2005-10-10

To make up their minds they can lick this \"disease\" by just making the decision never to use again. Just in the outcomes of Frey's friends from rehab....the long term prognosis for maintaining sobriety is wickedly small. And all the repeated advice from counselors implied that he would never make it without AA and the Twelve Steps. It is important to know that AA and the Twelve Steps really are helping to keep a lot of folks clean and sober. I think it is also important to note that there are a lot of \"dry drunks\" out there who have made this decision to never use again but they still suffer from \"stinkin thinkin.\" Can it be so horrible a thing to humbly admit that you don't have all the answers. That you might need, once in a while, to defer (surrender) to something greater than yourself....a collective source of wisdom, be it Tao or whatever? Is is so impossible to enter into the kind of humility to be able to advance to those steps where we go back and attempt to make a real amends to whoever we can for the brutal things we have done in the past? I have to wonder if Mr. Frey is going to wake up one day and realize that he has more \"recovering\" to do besides just getting sober enough to write a bestselling book.  <br />Addendum....Having just reread the Tao Te Ching I am better able to understand why Frey rejects \"God\" in the traditional western sense. In the Tao we read that \"the unnamable is the eternally real\".....and that \"the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\" Much of what Frey apparently rejects about God and the Higher Power thing must be this business of \"naming it.\" I can understand that.  <br />	2005-10-10

First, they start talking about the kinematics that result in trauma, and focus on teaching the reader on how interpreting and figuring out the event preceeding the trauma can give a better understanding of the injuries (external and potentially internal) the patient is suffering, and how to care for them, on the pre-hospital environment, without delaying transport to an appropriate medical facility because of executing unnecesary interventions. <br /> <br />The book not only deals with advanced life support procedures, but it deals greatly with basic procedures, so in the end, PHTLS is suitable for ANYONE that works with trauma patients on the pre-hospital environment. <br /> <br />When you buy the PHTLS book, be aware that you are going to read a book made with a totally differente approach. Think later of the methodology of care the PHTLS tries to propagate and you'll find out that, today, it is the best approach available for dealing with trauma patients. <br /> <br />You won't regret this purchase!	2005-10-10

As with her previous efforts, however, it's still a personal odyssey; as she notes in her acknowledgments, the inspiration for the novel is her grandfather (pictured on the jacket of the hardcover edition), who \"fought in the trenches of the German side of World War I\" before emigrating to the United States, and whose \"sons served on the American side in World War II.\"<br /><br />With the change in focus comes an appropriate change in pitch: there's far less magic realism and far more European naturalism. At times, the events and characters of \"The Master Butchers Singing Club\" resemble those from an offbeat soap opera, but Erdrich is far too deft a writer to let melodrama get the better of her storytelling. Beyond the occasional similarity to Lynch's Twin Peaks and the Coen brothers' Fargo, the more obvious influences are the prairie towns imagined by Sinclair Lewis and Willa Cather.<br /><br />The character modeled after her grandfather, Fidelis Waldvogel, arrives from Europe with his wife and a suitcase filled with sausage, which proves to be his currency to reach the Eden he imagines to be found in the Pacific Northwest. The money earned from sales of the meat, however, gets him only as far as the godforsaken desert of North Dakota, where he eventually becomes a much-admired shopkeeper and a stalwart member of the community. On the outskirts of the town lives the novel's heroine, Delphine Watzka, who has returned to her father's home from life on the road in a vaudeville show with her alleged husband, who (it is soon revealed) lives a double life. Eventually, the paths of these two dissimilar and distinctive families cross in momentous and bizarre ways<br /><br />The novel contains enough twists and mysteries to keep the pages turning: there's a triple killing uncovered upon Delphine's return, which is all the more inexplicable because the chief witness, her father, was too drunk to remember what happened; a terrifying tunnel collapse; an eccentric bag lady known as Step-and-a-Half, who has a couple of secrets all her own; and more. While each episode and revelation ranges from the farcical to the grisly, Erdrich mitigates the potential for Dickensian excess by subtly examining the effects of these events (some of which occur offstage) on her characters and on the community. And, although her work has always been infused with a comic edge, Erdrich displays a mordant (yet not unkind) wit here that differs from the tone of her earlier work.<br /><br />Above all, Erdrich has written a celebratory and emotional ode to the \"other\" side of her family, whose fortitude and charisma she clearly admires (and it's not hard to see why). Although she reassures us that \"the book is fiction except for snout salad, the bull's pizzle, and my grandmother's short stint as a human table in a vaudeville act,\" the reverence and the affection are as raw as the North Dakota wind.which is all the more inexplicable because the chief witness, her father, was too drunk to remember what happened; a terrifying tunnel collapse; an eccentric bag lady known as Step-and-a-Half, who has a couple of secrets all her own; and more.

He did not gloss over the difficulties of an LDR, but rather delved into them and exposed them.  His tone was often optimistic, but I appreciated this pragmatism, as I went to his book for advice rather than motivation.

Some of them are beautiful, but downright bizzare. Others make no effort at all to connect with the folklore and practices that are known from their original context. <br /> <br />Diana's book includes a brief survey for each rune of material from sources that are actually based on scholarly effort and practical use, along with the original folkloric rune poems themselves. This is combined with her extensive personal and community-based experience in scholarly, religious, and magical practice. It's not a thin book, but it is nevertheless a reasonably concise guide for material that would otherwise take a library to collect, if you could even find it all anymore. <br /> <br />I can say from firsthand experience that the rituals she includes are highly effective, and even kind of fun. The book works very well in a class setting, as it was designed and has been used repeatedly for that purpose. <br /> <br />--Ember--	2005-10-10

White? Where is the person who can write the history of a fresh presidential election cycle without alienating nearly half those who care enough to read it? Where is the scribe who can lead an anxious electorate back to its golden mean, to contemplate dispassionately on lessons learned, rather than battles lost and won?<br /><br />There's been a huge hole in the writing of contemporaneous political history since White's heyday, when his four \"Making Of The President\" books taking in the quadrennial election years 1960 through 1972 could be found on middle-class bookshelves across America without giving away the political leanings of the homeowner. But the hole is not quite as wide as I once thought, after discovering this book in the library. Of a piece with the \"Making Of\" series, the title suggests a condensing of 24 years in presidential politics, but really focuses on three elections White didn't cover in his previous histories, in brief those of 1956 and 1976, then, in greater detail, that of 1980.<br /><br />So what you really get here is a \"Making Of The President 1980\" with some opening observations on other campaigns. The book doesn't really tie up the whole of White's reporting with a \"here's-what-I-learned\" bow, and in that way the title's misleading, though he does offer some wisdom near the end accumulated from his experiences. One that sticks out: \"Critical elections are not fixed in history by election night returns; they depend on what the victor does with his victory.\"<br /><br />It was still an open question in early 1982, when this book was published, what Ronald Reagan would do with his 1980 victory. It was a bad spring for the economy, with high unemployment, a nasty recession, and popular unrest at home and abroad over the nuclear buildup Reagan was championing.<br /><br />But one gets a sense of White's sympathies being with Reagan all the same. He may not have understood conservatives, and writes of the anti-abortion movement particularly with deep scorn, but you sense reading White's observations about the 1970s and the election of Jimmy Carter that White's faith in liberalism, so clear in his \"Making Of The President 1960\" hagiography of John F. Kennedy, had not just been challenged but routed by the failure of the Great Society, the war in Vietnam, and the culture of complaint that became rooted around the Democratic party.<br /><br />\"They had set out to free everyone and had created a nation of dependents instead,\" White writes. Add to that a brittle president (Jimmy Carter) unable to make tough, effective decisions, and you have a clear recipe for change.<br /><br />It wasn't that White was a liberal or a conservative, or even a moderate. It was that he was able to take in all political viewpoints, weigh their respective merits and minuses, and offer in the end something deep and penetrating about what was going on with the nation at the time of any particular election. He had a deep vocabulary, an ear for the telling quote, an eye for vivid detail, but his greatest strength was his open mind.<br /><br />White writes especially well of Carter, his colorful Democratic challengers in 1980, and gets a penetrating interview with Reagan near Election Day where the exhausted candidate can't let go of his Carter attacks. \"I wonder whether he's confusing some of his own statements with having come from God,\" Reagan offers. White is more cutting here than in his earlier books, but he takes pains to present all his portraits in sympathetic context, and frankly, his acerbic takes on Carter are very entertaining.<br /><br />It's not a full-blooded \"Making Of\" book, and White does test your patience with a lengthy examination of the 1980 census, but given the resounding importance of the 1980 election, it's nice to have White's voice offering commentary one last time, and sad to reflect upon how it has been missed.rly with deep scorn, but you sense reading White's observations about the 1970s and the election of Jimmy Carter that White's faith in liberalism, so clear in his \"Making Of The President 1960\" hagiography of John F.

Her father decides to have the house remodelled and engages the services of genius architect Erik D'Anton, who has very strict conditions for his participation, one of which is that he will only visit at night. Watching from the window as he arrives, Marisa first notices the black Lamborghini, and then the cape that the visitor wears. Once he's inside and she is introduced, she realises why he is so reclusive. His face is ruined, destroyed by an accident when he was seven. He wears a mask to cover up the fact that he has no nose and his skin is puckered and discoloured. <br /> <br />Marisa is drawn to this enigmatic, disfigured stranger who speaks only in a whisper, and demands that her father invite him to dinner. Erik, who never accepts social invitations, agrees, because he is equally drawn to Marisa. That dinner-party begins an at first covert, and later open, relationship between the two. <br /> <br />This book reads like a thirteen-year-old's attempt at novel-writing. We have the poor, reclusive hero with the tragic past, the man no-one can reach. We have the beautiful, pure young maiden who is the only one to see past the scars and into his soul. We have Erik falling deeply in love with Marisa, pining for her, driven desperate by his love for her. We even have Marisa ending up seriously ill in hospital as a result of pining for Erik - and, naturally, her illness brings him back rushing to her side. And, after her father dies tragically, of course Erik puts his own needs aside and is there for her, even braving the stares of all and sundry as he ventures out - horrors! - in daylight. And, of course, he then marries her. <br /> <br />Oh, the melodrama! Oh, the self-indulgence! Oh, the Mary Sue effect! (If you don't know what a Mary Sue story is, Google it. It will sound surprisingly like this book).  <br /> <br />It's all so improbable. I mean, really! A 31-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl? Doesn't that strike anyone as ever so slightly... sick? Almost paedophilic, even. Especially as she was 15 when they first met. Whether she was 16 or 17 when they first had sex I don't recall, but either way had I been her father or her housekeeper I'd have called the police. But apart from that, what on earth would this intelligent, professional *adult* see in this spoilt, over-indulged child? That baffled me until, as the book dragged on, I realised that Erik is little more than a child himself. He hides from the world, stuck in his own little universe of self-pity. It's no wonder that he has his `assistant', Raskin, to look after him; he's not safe to be let out alone. <br /> <br />In fact, even ten, fifteen years later, when Erik and Marisa have been married for well over a decade, it's quite clear that neither of them could manage without Raskin and Kitty. Those two are the nursemaids looking after two mentally stunted thirteen-year-olds in adult bodies. Oh, poor me! Nobody loves me! Everybody hates me! I hate myself!  <br /> <br />Certain parts of the book had me rolling my eyes even more than others. When Marisa phones Erik, early on, to ask why he's avoiding her and asks why he hates her, I couldn't believe that he wasn't repulsed by her childish behaviour. But, no, he beats himself up for making her unhappy and actually invites her to spend time with him. And when she turns up in her *nightgown* night after night he never even comments, let alone suggests that she might consider dressing more appropriately.  <br /> <br />Then there's the whole question of Erik's face. Hasn't he ever heard of plastic surgery? Prosthetics? Sure, he had 22 skin grafts when he was a kid. But that was more than 20 years ago by the time the book starts. Isn't he aware of the advances in medical science? Does he really want to hide from the world that badly? Or is it that Vale Allen will stop at nothing to produce this pale travesty of Phantom of the Opera? <br /> <br />Oh, and then there's Marisa's problems with contraception. Hasn't Erik ever heard of condoms? <br /> <br />I agree with at least one other reviewer that it's astonishing this teenage diary fodder ever saw the light of day. What a waste of paper! <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-10-09

Yet the people that need to know the stupidity of blind faith will never read End of Faith except for religious icons to tell their flock not to read the book. <br />But, having said that, Mr. Harris's book is the best written to combat faith whether people like myself can understand all of it. The end of religious intolerance needed a push, and Mr. Harris helped get it going with End of Faith.	2005-10-09

The drama that unfolds between the hero, Phillip, and the heroine, Eloise, is emotional, believable, and very well written. This isn't my favorite book of Julia Quinn but it still is wonderful. The author has a great gift in her ability to develop characters. This was another terrific romance from an author who has the ability to break down her characters souls and feed their emotional struggles onto the pages. I absolutely couldn't put the book down until I was finished. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Philip and Eloise in this very excellent character driven romance. I must say that the last quarter of the book was quite emotional, poignant and romantic. I even shed a few tears!	2005-10-09

There is much that is good in it and it is solidly Catholic. But I don't think it \"hits the mark\" for the majority of faithful Catholic women today, that is those who do not fit the model of Mrs. Martin. The main point of disparity is that most Catholic women do not have faithful Catholic husbands, like Mrs. Martin does, who function as the spiritual heads of the households. So much in this book is founded on the premise that they do.<br /><br />She makes a point in one chapter about how astounded someone was to hear all five of her children had the same father.  I wondered at that point about the women reading the book who haven't come from such a wonderful past as she, who have made serious mistakes, whose children do not all have the same father, yet still want to be \"women of grace\". There was nothing in the book about coming out of an imperfect past (and haven't we all really?), finding forgiveness and striving to become the women of grace God wants us to be.<br /><br />I also found the format difficult to deal with. Maybe I'm just not the \"write in the answers\" type of person, but I really did not like so many questions with simple, one-word answers. The book is not really a Bible study, but a Bible-referenced topical presentation.	2005-10-09

When I perused the text looking at issues and dipping here and there into the essays I did not notice any particular problems with the readings.  Looking very closely at them now, there appears a clear conservative slant.  My students have found finding these biases interesting at first, but the slanting soon became a point of annoyance for them.   <br /> <br />Her section on ethics and the law takes easy shots at lawyers for greed and deception, ignoring more relevant issues of privacy, or government and the individual.   <br /> <br />Her readings on religion and education dismiss opponents to religion in schools with ad hominem fallacies. <br /> <br />The ethics and the media readings overtly assert that the media is a liberal tool:  with the sneer that that accompanies the label \"liberal\" these days. <br /> <br />If you have an agenda in the classroom, a red state agenda, you might like this book very much.  The examples consistently mention Democratic party affliation and portray Democrats badly, while Republican bad examples either fail to mention party affliation, or are otherwise minimized in emphasis, length and number. <br />The reading selections commit any number of fallacies and employ frequent propaganda techniques: ad hominem,  ad populum,  transfer, name calling, etc. <br /> <br />I do not recommend this book for serious ethical study unless you wish to have before you a steady diet of slanted evidence with a clear political agenda, logical fallacies, and occasionally just plain poor writing.	2005-10-09

The podcasting titles are starting to show up fast and furious.  I recently received a copy of O'Reilly's Podcasting Hacks - Tips & Tools for Blogging Out Loud by Jack D. Herrington.  It's a very good choice for both the rank novice as well as the person who wants to take their podcasting to the next level...<br /><br />Contents:  Tuning into Podcasts; Starting Out; Quality Sound; Formats; Interviewing; Blogging; Publicity; Basic Editing; Advanced Audio; On the Go; Videoblogging; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Some of the Hacks titles cover a wide range of tips and hints on a subject, and you end up picking and choosing what works for you.  There are a few that seem to go a step beyond and provide a pretty complete coverage of how to get started with something, as well as how to improve your skills if you've already started.  Podcasting Hacks seems to fall nicely into that second category.  There is some coverage on how to get going with listening to podcasts, like #8 - Listening to Podcasts on Your PDA and #9 - Podcatching with Your PlayStation Portable.  There's even a number of Perl hacks you can use to do some \"roll your own\" development.  But the book really shines when you get into the main areas of how to produce a podcast.  You'll learn how to pick the right microphone (#13) for your needs, how to set up a home studio (#61), and even how to produce your podcasts in surround sound (#16).  Add in a number of recommendations of hardware and software, and you've got a valuable guide to becoming the next voice to be heard...<br /><br />Unless you're already an Adam Curry in the podcasting world, this is a book worth reading.  You'll either get off to a good start, or you'll take your podcasting to the next level.  Either way, your audience will thank you...	2005-10-09

I found this book to be not quite as bad as some reviewers have, but not quite as good as it promised. It was definitely readable, and intriguing. There was a clever dual story which unfolded concerning the royal confectioner, Miss Cornwallis, who crafted 'subtleties' for the royal court and of course, Anne Boleyn. The parallel story of the confectioner was actually more interesting to me than the Anne Boleyn story. The author does a good job of making  characters such as musician Mark Smeaton 'real' and not not footnotes of history. Her treatment of Queen Anne, to which most reviewers seem to object, is not overly sympathetic--neither is is particularly crass. The author explains in the endnotes the use of names such as Tom and Tommy, for Cromwell and Cranmer, as a way to help distinguish their personalities. This is presuming that Anne would not have referred to either of them in her diary notes by their surnames.  The storyline is uneven...I was never 100 percent sure if the two tales were entirely parallel..but it does provide an interesting perspective as to the roles of the Queen and the commoner/confectioner.  If you're looking for a book highly sympathic to Anne Boleyn, this isn't it. Neither is it anti-Anne. Suzannah Dunn has done an interesting job of trying to make Anne contemporary in thought and in feel.  Perhaps that is the problem. Her times--the roles of women, the 'chivalry and romance' of her time, do not translate to the current day. Worth a read? Yes, I think so. The author is definitely a talented storyteller. As I can attest, you can't tell anyone what to write--had she done a novel strictly about the confectioner, and tied that in to her times and the Court of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, it might have been received better. Still, definitely a good read, for a novelization about Anne's 'diary' and memories. Keep in mind that excellent novels, such as The Lady in the Tower, are already out there. If you're like me, and always looking for something 'new' to read about Anne of the Thousand Days, you will probably find this book of interest. Could it have been better? With 20/10 hindsight, yes, of course. Still, it's a well researched, nicely written novel.ng 'new' to read about Anne of the Thousand Days, you will probably find this book of interest.

These are families made up of Witches and their Protectors, living in the England of the Middle Ages. They know their situation is dire, and they struggle fiercely against the widening impositions of the Church. They fight to the death to maintain the sanctity of their beliefs, their rites and their beloved Goddess. <br />Croll Di Dio's descriptions are both heartwarming and heartbreaking. We ride alongside legendary heros and heroines full of strength and single-minded determination, who are sometimes aided by magic and sometimes alone. These are people who are committed to each other, who feel community and family are one and the same. We undeniably feel their emotions through all the joys they share and the calamities they endure. <br />And best of all, you get to spend more time with all the wonderful people you met in \"Sherwood Forest,\" plus an extra one or two. It is an exciting, sometimes erotic and always spellbinding work of fiction, and I recommend it highly.	2005-10-09

While one may encounter shadows of post-diasporic experience in the stories, \"Casual Water\" and \"Yellow\", Lee does not preoccupy readers with plot lines most often associated with the work of more commonly known Asian-American writers. <br /> <br />Instead, he illustrates well the various issues assimilated Asian-Americans face as they live in a country where occasionally, they are reminded of their immigration status, regardless of whether they have been born in the United States. For Lee, race politics includes a Chinese thug who questions his Korean-American attorney about his white girlfriend in \"Voir Dire\", presuming that a white girlfriend automatically indicates a form of race treachery. Annie Yung, in the delightful, \"Lone Night Cantina\", assumes a cowgirl identity only to find herself facing the problems with assuming an identity that is not authentic to her person.  <br /> <br />Some Asian-American students will react to Yellow by arguing that they do not find Lee's characters \"Asian\" enough which begs the question: What does it mean to be Asian/Asian-American and what are the risks of narrowly-defining characteristics that ultimately lead to essentialism. Feminists have been right to point out how essentialism damages women and similarly, readers can bring their assumptions to the book so long as they understand that reading Lee's work may cast new light and perhaps, widen the spectrum of race representation. Readers who presume to know what \"Asian\" is may find themselves struggling with Lee's honest portrayal which avoids reinforcing images of Asian-Americans as perpetually struggling, self-hating, or striking nationalistic attitudes. Marked with a fluidity of language and expression, Lee's affection for his characters allows them genuine epiphanies without sentimentalism.  <br />	2005-10-09

Not to *!SPOIL*! anyone's enjoyment of the book, if anyone is still reading this old thing, but it seems to be the story of a family of demon-possessed firstborn children who are cursed by Judas Iscariot in the time of Christ. Over the centuries, they make their way to a remote mountain location in America, where they intermarry, breed, and feud with a family of werewolves. What exactly this cursed family is capable of, or what they are, is never explained, and the story of the werewolf family is never explained either. The book is too short to go into detail about either family, and not much is very frightening about it. There are a couple of creepy scenes involving a sister who disappeared over two decades ago, but that's about it. The ending is not very satisfying, and the whole story is rather pointless. It's an okay way to kill a few hours, though, so I guess it isn't a complete waste of time. Well, that's my opinion, hope it helps.	2005-10-09

Enriching Their Lives	It's great that clicker training has finally gone to the birds!  Clicker training, indeed any training with positive reinforcement techniques, is rewarding for both you and your bird.  This book is a great place to get started with training, and building a positive relationship with your bird.<br /><br />What many people realize after they start working with their bird is that training tricks/new behaviors offers up a whole new world of behavior for them.  For you, it creates an entirely new way of interacting with and appreciating your feathered companion.<br /><br />You are also likely to experience a reduction in problem behavior frequency (biting, screaming, feather destruction, etc) when your bird learns new behaviors (like they can with clicker training).  While this book of priceless information offers much more,  a reduction in problem behaviors alone is WELL worth the investment.<br /><br />This book is a great guide for both beginners and experienced teacher/trainers alike.	2005-10-08

The main character Bullet, a high school track star and an obstinate loner, is a racist. This is all right, as the book is set in the sixties. However, the protagonist does not noticeably change by the end of the book. He has had a new wrinkle put in his ideas about race, but he is pretty much the same personality that began the book. Whether this bothers you or not depends on your idea of an effective story and intriguing protagonist. <br />	2005-10-08

I am a huge fan of Ms. Roberts work and applaud her moving more into stories where the emphasis is more on the mystery than the romance.  This was a well-crafted story, beginning when Reena is young and traveling through experiences in her life to present day.  The excellent characters, relationships, dialogue and sense of place, along with the romance and intimate scenes that are the hallmark of Robert's writing are all here.  The only problem I had was that you know the villain from the beginning, so it does diminish the element of suspense.  Still, it is understandable that Reena doesn't put it together until the end and the final scenes bring the suspense into the story.  There is graphic violence and profanity, but it's realistic and clear that Roberts did her research on fires.  Roberts is an excellent writer who has a permanent place on my \"must buy\" list.	2005-10-08

I don't see my friend that often but I am really happy to have met her. The most important thing I learned was that I had to know what I was putting in my mouth and how much. I had to move, walk, jump and run, I couldn't sit on the couch and expect to lose weight because I knew how much fat I was eating. Knowing wasn't enough. I had to burn off the fat already on my body.

It's brilliant, and it contains some of Dostoyevsky's finest writing.  A passage in which the book's protagonist walks into a room and then into a girl's eyes springs immediately to mind, and has stayed with me ever since I first read this book years ago.<br /><br />And, unlike Dostoyevksy's more widely read works, in this book, Dostoyevsky often takes the opportunity to digress from the novel's story and tell his personal opinions on what he's writing about, whether the subject be an event in the story or a particular theme the author feels strongly about.  These digressions present a great opportunity for the reader to really get to know this amazing writer.<br /><br />But the story and the characters are reasons enough to give this book a go, preferably after first reading \"The Brothers Karamazov,\" \"Crime and Punishment,\" or some of Dostoyevky's shorter works.<br /><br />It's a great book, very rewarding, and well worth your time.	2005-10-08

This autobiography is compulsively readable.  I first saw Kyle Maynard on a TV sports documentary and I'm glad to say that his determination and strength of character comes across as well on the page as it did on the screen.  It also told me a lot I didn't know about the guy, including his success in other sports such as powerlifting and football.  There is also good use of color and black and white photos to illustrate his story.    I almost cried several times whilst reading this book.  Not because it's sad but rather because it states a few simple truths that we all need reminding of.  I particularly enjoyed the way in which Kyle makes his story a tribute not only to his own tenacity but also to that of his family, friends and coaches.  Even simple things like memories of his grandmother taking him to the local park are remarkably touching.    The only time I felt sorry for the author was when he was wrestling in the state finals with a badly broken nose and his opponent starts (illegally) kicking him in the face, out of view of the referee.  It's a testament to him (or perhaps wrestlers generally) that he doesn't complain but just carries on trying to win the match.  I have always felt that wrestling is an all-encompassing activity - a thing in itself - but it really took this book to prove it to me.  You feel like cheering when his much-loved coach rushes out at the end of the contest and raises Kyle onto his shoulders.    I'm the sort of person who skips big chunks of books if I get bored.  But I loved \"No Excuses\".  I read every word.	2005-10-08

This book has been a revelation to me on the order of Paul's vision on the road to Damascus. It seems that with this book, every question and misunderstanding of christianity is now explainable with this powerfull light of thruth. Truly, the motto of The Theosophical Society, which is \"There is no religion higher than truth\" is especially applicable when this book takes christianity head on. <br />This book is on par for me with my other favorite books on the origins of christianity, those being the works of Andrew D. Benson (\"The Origins of Christianity and the Bible\", and \"The True Origins of Christianity and the Bible\") and the great works of Acharya S. (\"The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold\", and \"The Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha, and Christ Unveiled\"). <br />My main criticism of this book is that I don't think Atwill went thoroughly enough into the matters concerning Paul and his transformation into one of the main christian saints, and explaining Paul as he was before \"The War with the Jews\" and his subsequent character make-over and his theology changes. The second criticism is there is no extensive bibliography, only a short one, and there is no index (which I feel is very important for people doing serious study). But there are notes for sources. <br />I highly recommend this book for those who are willing to read and consider works scholarly, critical or different from the typical christian apologist's view. Again, as that quoted motto says \"There is NO religion higher than truth\", and \"You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free\". These are especially meaningful in regards to this book. <br /> <br />My Subconscious Self	2005-10-08

Then I met a fellow fantasy buff who told me I was a worthless peon unless I picked up the Dark Tower series. And so, I gave it a chance and found out he was right. It took me six months to finish Mr. King's masterpiece, but some have taken far longer--those that have followed it since book 1, written in the 70's, the second book he ever published. This is Stephen King's magnum opus, and it's one of the best, most entertaining series I have ever read. <br /> <br />Where to start? There are a million things I want to say about the Dark Tower. I shall start at the beginning I guess. <br /> <br />Roland of Gilead is Mid-World's last gunslinger. The world is moving on. Fundamental concepts like time, distance, and direction are blurring. At the center of it all is the Dark Tower. The Dark Tower holds all the mysteries of the universe and all the answers to the same. Reaching the Dark Tower is the gunslinger's quest, and the core of these seven books. <br /> <br />The above paragraph is pretty much book 1 in a nutshell. Weighing in at no more than 100 or so pages, it does no more than introduce us to Roland and the man in black; the protagonist and the antagonist. We get a character profile, a few action scenes, some fancy dramatic writing, and boom, it's over. <br /> <br />The Drawing of the Three is where I (and King, if you read the foreword) consider the true beginning of the quest for the Dark Tower. This book is where Roland \"draws\" characters out of New York City from different \"whens\" that form his quest party, or ka-tet. I personally enjoyed this book above all the rest--so much so that I immediately coughed up the money to buy books 3 through 7, the last one being a hardcover no less. <br /> <br />The quest of Roland and his ka-tet reads like a western (gunslingers, six-shooter revolvers), a medieval fantasy (talking in thee's and thou's), a sci-fi (robots, machines, A.I.), and a modern thriller (NYC is a prominent back-drop throughout) thrown into a blender. It gets really crazy around book 5, then completely off the deep-end in book 6. With the big picture in my mind, I cannot fairly categorize it as anything, really. The Dark Tower is such a unique combination of genres, it's a testament to Stephen King's ability as a writer. He didn't sell all those books by accident. <br /> <br />King's writing is an easy flowing style that comes from a combination of casual genius in language and taleweaving. Besides book 1 (the manuscript of which was first written when he was 19), I never had any trouble or frustration reading his story. He paces every plot well, gives every character a unique soul, and describes every scenario concisely. <br /> <br />The most amazing thing about The Dark Tower is it's also a metaphor for King's works. It's not just the center of Roland's universe, it's the center of all universes that are swirling in the writer's warped mind. Characters like Father Callahan from 'Salem's Lot, Ted Brautigan from Hearts in Atlantis, the crazy clown from It, Patrick Danville from Insomnia, Randall Flagg from The Stand, and scores of others make appearences ranging from major characters to cameos throughout the series. <br /> <br />It's not perfect. When a series spans 30 years, consistency becomes a problem. To King's credit, he knows this, and has, in his many forewords, admitted it was the hardest story he ever wrote. Most of the time, he just wrote what popped into his head, consequences be damned. But even when the story flies into the WTF level of the stratosphere, I remain compelled to flip the pages because 1.) at least things aren't bogged down to a standstill, and 2.) I care about the characters. <br /> <br />The latter point is the heart of all successful fantasy/sci-fi books--characters that live in worlds, galaxies, universes different from ours, but exhibit personalities, traits, and habits that we identify with and grow to care for. From the first page of The Gunslinger to the last page of The Dark Tower, over three thousand in total, following Roland's quest with his ka-tet was pure pleasure. Forget Harry Potter and Lord of the Dreary Rings. This is THE fantasy series to read... and you are a peon until you do.	2005-10-08

In my opinion, this \"book\" is a calling card to sell services and products that common sense often may give you for free.*    As follows, with a bit of \"tongue and cheek\"    \"1. Surviving the Toxic Crisis focuses on teaching you how to identify the health suppressors, how to remove deadly toxins from your body and environment, and how to avoid them in the future.\"    Eat well and participate in a healthy, active life-style and environment! (Go to Henry's or Mother's Market. Heck, go to Trader Joes or Vons and ask the assistant to the assistant manger what s/he would recommend)    \"2. Decades of destruction-Many years after exposure to chemicals and pesticides, body fat can release these stored deadly elements and cause life-shortening degenerative diseases.\"    Go on a liquid fast for a week and take some vitamins! I am not a toxicologist so I am not sure how body fat can release the related chemicals and pesticides by fasting. But I do know that being thinner is healthier as compared with being thicker; so get rid of excess body fat--like you didn't know that already. See my comments above.    \"3. Tagalong terrorists-Unwanted elements in your water and unwanted elements in your food might be making you sick.\"    \"Might\" is the operative word. Drink mountain spring water, read labels and eat organic foods. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (The Mormons) had this right since 1833! (*a)  And how about the Jews? (*b)     \"4. Dental time bombs-Heavy metals in fillings root canals and electrical charges from dental metals can shorten your life.\"    Go to Mexico and have your metal-based fillings replaced for next to nothing (assuming that you believe this one, this is likely the only thing that may hurt physically and financially with the Kellas program!) If you have a lot of gold fillings or gold teeth contact me directly and I will personally pay for removal. But I keep the gold. (Looking ahead, \"gold prices should continue higher into next week,\" with the next major price resistance level at $497-$505/ounce level, which could hit by mid-November 2005.)    \"5. Unwelcome bugs-How you invite them-Pathogenic microbes like amoebas, fungus, viruses, and bacteria can move in when the body is weakened by the primary suppressors.\"    Put up an \"Unwelcome\" sign at your environmental doorstep to life ; perhaps even a sign that says you drink heavily, enjoy fireworks, have a gun and a large dog that bits! Be proactive on this and your general health. Exercise may also help for all 5 issues set out--ya think?     Look under \"Exterminator\" in the Yellow Pages for additional needed help.      *(a)    That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him.    And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make.    And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies.    And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.

Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving;    nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;    And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.    All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep onthe earth;    And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger.    All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground--    Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.    And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;    And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;    And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.    *(b)    Many modern Jews think that the laws of kashrut are simply primitive health regulations that have become obsolete with modern methods of food preparation. There is no question that some of the dietary laws have some beneficial health effects. For example, the laws regarding kosher slaughter are so sanitary that kosher butchers and slaughterhouses have been exempted from many USDA regulations.    Although the details of Kashrut are extensive, the dietary laws all derive from a few fairly simple, straightforward rules:    Certain animals may not be eaten at all. This restriction includes the flesh, organs, eggs and milk of the forbidden animals:    Of the animals that may be eaten, the birds and mammals must be killed in accordance with Jewish law.  All blood must be drained from the meat or broiled out of it before it is eaten.    Certain parts of permitted animals may not be eaten.    Meat (the flesh of birds and mammals) cannot be eaten with dairy. Fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables and grains can be eaten with either meat or dairy. (According to some views, fish may not be eaten with meat).    Utensils that have come into contact with meat may not be used with dairy, and vice versa.     Utensils that have come into contact with non-kosher food may not be used with kosher food.    This applies only where the contact occurred while the food was hot.    Grape products made by non-Jews may not be eaten.    *Finally,    (...)    ...and only the best wishes to you on your path to great health.	2005-10-08

For example, did the author ever have children? If so, those tales would be perfect sequel material. <br /> <br />The author excels at relating personal anecdotes of her cultural lessons and her efforts to become \"Almost French.\" The other Amazon reviews of this book highlight her dinner party gaffes, which, I agree, provide for some of the most entertaining paragraphs. <br /> <br />I also enjoyed reading about the author's increasing skill at nasty retorts and her feelings of conflict about this necessary public skill. <br /> <br />What didn't I like? The constant references to her terrier are in one way annoying, but in another, completely genuine and even cute. I realize pet dogs are ingrained in many people's lives, and not just in Paris, but around the world. Even so, as a former dog owner I grew tired of the perhaps excessive time spent on this subject. <br /> <br />In addition, I wish the author would have gone into more detail about her attempts to become fluent in French. She did note, repetitiously, that the French enjoy wordplay, but it seems as though one day after many chapters about struggling to comprehend the language, out of the blue, she could suddenly speak fluent, nuanced French. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an enjoyable book and I recommend it to anyone planning to visit Paris or anyone interested in exploring the trials and tribulations of expatriate life.	2005-10-08

I just finished reading it and had to write this review. Imagine there were a special celebration of heterosexual marriage somewhere in the U.S. Imagine that straight couples who went there for the celebration would have to wait in line for hours in the rain and face heckling, hateful protesters, and even then might not get the special recognition of their marriage, their lives together in love, that they had been waiting for. Imagine how much in love any couples who would undergo that trial would have to be. Now you have a sense for the kind of love you can read about in Dumesnil's book. This is such an exciting time of change in America. I hope we look back, years from now, in an age of Marriage Equality and feel pride and gratitude for the couples in this book for paving the way in this important civil rights movement. Truly a powerful read--I was moved to tears by almost every story.	2005-10-07

However, as movie companies shy away from oversaturated sequels, Jason takes to the books. We dealt with the Jason X books which were rather weak. Here we have a closer essence to what Friday the 13th and Jason Voorhees is about. With some of the sequels we dealt with, this could easily be adapted to a screenplay and movie.<br /><br />Unlike others, I placed this book to take place after Part 8 (Manhattan). Church cult leader Father Eric Long has indoctorined that Jason is the right hand of God and is His instrument in judging the righteous over the sinners. Long and his lackey Curtis Rickles manage to discover Jason's body submerged in Crystal Lake. Long has taken the lease over on Camp Crystal Lake and moves his congregation of the Church of the Heavenly Vessel along with the crucified corpse of Jason he now displays to his followers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a gov't group known only as The Agency has sent a batch of soldiers into the area to capture Jason Voorhees, not knowing that the Church is at Crystal Lake now but still thinking Jason is up and mobile. Elsewhere, Long & co-horts manage to revive Jason who immediately begins doling out 'judgement'. So begins the rise of Jason and his death toll.<br /><br />The reason I place this after Part 8 is that it can be the first attempt by the Agency to secure Jason, and Part 9 (Jason Goes to Hell) begins with an agency SWAT team actually taking him out before going into the rebirth storyline. I feel it fits better here than it does for coming between parts 7&8.<br /><br />For fans of the series, this is a fun book that reads as one of the movies. I would have liked a different ending to stop Jason but hey, it works but will make it hard for the next writer to bring him back. None-the-less, you get the feeling and flavor of a Jason slaughter in this gorefest. I've stated in other reviews, there are times I just want to read a book, not for plot but for sheer enjoyment, and being a fan of the F13 franchise, this book is great brain-jelly for the fan because we probably won't see another Jason movie anytime soon.e are times I just want to read a book, not for plot but for sheer enjoyment, and being a fan of the F13 franchise, this book is great brain-jelly for the fan because we probably won't see another Jason movie anytime soon.	2005-10-07

Not much is known about the queen making her that much more fascinating. Finding an extended book about Nefertiti is hard to find due to the fact that her history is so vague. This book is probably one of the best about the queen and the book is relatively recent, so the information and new \"discoveries\" about her are pretty accurate. Not the whole book is about Nefertiti because we don't really know that much about her. The book also describes  Amenhotep III and Queen Tiy, the parents of the fascinating Akhenaten. Akhenaten is the other major person besides Nefertiti in the book. He was the husband of Nefertiti as well as the first prominent monotheistic figure in history. One does get the idea of Nefertiti's almost goddess-like presence in Egypt as well as her high status in society often ruling equally beside her husband in the book. Tyldesley does a great job with Nefertiti. This is probably a must have book for Nefertiti as well as Akhenaten.	2005-10-07

Even in the current litigious climate of corporate America, Wal-Mart manages to succeed at completely indoctrinating its \"associates\" to believe in the \"values\" of the company, which are as \"good ole boy\" as they can get.  Liza Featherstone's account of the Dukes vs. Wal-Mart class action lawsuit (now certified, still unresolved), the largest in U.S. legal history, makes up for in content what it may lack in an elegant writing style (it's a bit bare bones and stilted at times).  The women involved in the lawsuit aren't the typical bleeding-heart liberals that would be easy for Wal-Mart to discredit; they are by and large very religious, relatively conservative women who are trying to get by on very low wages and zero respect.  The consistency with which women have been kept to the lowest paying, lowest power positions within the company is nothing less than appalling; using both ample statistics as well as countless personal interviews, Featherstone assaults the reader with a barrage of terrible realities.  Many of the employees at Wal-Mart cannot afford to spend 50% of their income on the company health plan, so they end up on state or federal assistance.  Women are discouraged from applying to management positions.  If this reading this book does not convince you to boycott Wal-Mart, it would be surprising.	2005-10-06

Kim Wilson manages to extract references to tea in novels and letters using them as examples of its importance at the time, and its use as a literary device. <br /> <br />this has a series of lovely recipes in it which are true to Austen's time, well as true as they can be. Ingredients and measurements not withstanding. But how wonderful to do tea just as Austen did. <br /> <br />This book is highly specialised around Tea and really Austen and perhaps the Jane Austen in the title was supposed to draw in more readers on the Jane Austen bandwagon. However I do think it has merit. Firstly it tended to stick with things of Austen's time and I felt it gave a fairly good discussion of what her life would have been. <br /> <br />It really suffered from lack of illustration, not only throughout the book, but also for the cooking items at the end. I recommend reading this with another illustrated book of Austen's life if you want to see more of the places and things mentioned in here. There is one excellent book I have read recently called Regency Design which (while not on Jane Austen) will illustrate so much of what they used, ate from, drank from and lived in. It is fully illustrated, I think the author is Morley - anyway - a book like that is an excellent accompaniment to lovely short books such as this.	2005-10-06

I love sci-fi novels but my favorite types are those dealing with \"time travel\" and those about the state of the human race FAR into the future.  This novel caught my interest because of the \"Robinson Crusoe\" theme. <br /> <br />This one did not disappoint me as I finished it in just a few days.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5-stars was that there is no sequel.  I think a follow-up story would have great potential.  Who knowa ... maybe the author is working on one now.  I can only hope! <br />	2005-10-06

Okay, everybody's carping about how I have nothing to say about the book.  C'mon, I'm busy reviewing Lindsay Lohan movies and Playstation stuff, plus this is the fourth review I've written today - you don't think I actually have time to read a book, do you??  Anyway, as usual, I went ahead and read the editors' reviews here at Amazon - and checked the chatroom chatter -  and so now can jive with the best of `em.    See, they say that John O'Neill discredits John Kerry's wartime credentials in an effort to prove him unworthy of a position equated to the status of Commander In Chief.  No duh.      Okay, how's this.  The basis for his arguments is all second and third hand information, usually picked up from someone else's research, like  Douglas Brinkley's biography, then twisted beyond recognition.  Those FBI records?  Does he mention that they found no evidence that Kerry did anything wrong?  Then of course there are those, uh  \"interviews,\" many of which are of people who never even knew Kerry in Vietnam, some of which are of guys who have forgotten what their own records say, or who are under investigation for lying on their \"affidavit.\"   And more than one vet who was \"interviewed\" has publicly criticized O'Neill for misreporting what he said.   I just can't figure out why they didn't bother to interview the only member of their Swift Boat Vets outfit who actually saw Kerry win his Silver Star - you know, he says he thinks Kerry earned it.    I guess it was enough that O'Neill just twisted a third hand account of something someone else reported about him.    I guess I should have read some actual source material before posting my other review.  If I had, I would have known that Kerry was not \"dismissed\" six months in advance, but requested early transfer.    Even Tom Wright, who claims to have urged him to leave, can't account for the discrepancies in his own story.  If I'd looked at Kerry's records, I would have known that even as he left Vietnam, he got first-rate fitness reports from a man who called him \"the acknowledged leader among his peers.\"  My bad.    Now, I've read in the chatrooms that Kerry burned villages without direct order, and slaughtered domestic animals owned by the civilians.  I guess if I had read the book, I would have known that it was George Bates who made that claim, but it turns out his own crewman says he actually did it.  He also says George Bates didn't have room to say anything as he had a lot of problems of his own.   Oops.   Another Swift Boat winner.   I guess I also would have known that dozens of sailors got Purple Hearts for minor injuries of questionable origin during that time - after all, the LA Times looked at the records and wrote all about it.   But hey, what do they know, anyway ??!!   If I had looked at the records myself  I would have known that ol' Rocky Hildreth and two others got Purple Hearts on the same day as one of Kerry's - and they didn't lose even a day of duty!!  They got sent right back with bandaids on !!!    My bad when I said Kerry had a video camera.  I forgot there was no such thing in those days.  If I actually knew anyone who went to Vietnam, I guess I'd know that they sold those little 8mm movie cameras to all the GIs at the PX, and lots of Swift Boat guys took movies - you can see it on their websites.   I guess I was looking at the wrong websites !!!    Oh, and I guess if I had read anything by anyone who's actually seen Kerry's movies, I'd know that he didn't \"stage exaggerated versions of combat strategies and tactics,\" and hardly even appears in them.  Oh well, who's gonna notice?     My boo boo when I said Kerry was the \"head\" of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, as it turns out he was just one of the directors and a spokesman.   But I can still repeat chatroom gossip about what he did there, can't I?   Okay, maybe I should actually look up federal law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice before I repeat someone else's mistakes.  But hey, if it'son the Internet, it must be true!!!    In conclusion, I think I've done a pretty darn good job of spinning chatroom gossip and bookflap blather into a pretend review.  Who says you have to actually read the book??!!!	2005-10-06

David Markham's latest book, Napoleon for Dummies, is the perfect book for someone who wants to get the lowdown on Napoleon. It combines outstanding scholarship (Markham is a top international Napoleonic scholar and award-winning author) with the easy reading style associated with the Dummies series, and takes the reader beyond the stereotypes and to the real Napoleon. If the rest of the biographies in this new series are anywhere as good as Markham's biography of Napoleon, then Wiley Publishers will have created a real winner. <br /> <br />The first thing you discover when you read Napoleon for Dummies is that it really isn't for dummies at all. It is for people who enjoy a good read and would like to find out more about Napoleon. As one would expect, Markham writes in an easy, accessible style that should appeal to all readers. The book is well-organized and easy to follow. In his introduction, Markham explains why we should even care about Napoleon, giving examples of why that great man was important both to people of his time and to those of us living in the 21st century.  <br /> <br />In successive chapters, Markham traces Napoleon's life from his early days on Corsica to his career-ending defeats and exile. Throughout this discussion, Markham points out both good and bad decisions, and does not hesitate to call some of Napoleon's actions into questions. It is also clear, however, that Markham sees Napoleon as a positive force in history. But this feeling is based on careful analysis of Napoleon and his legacy, an analysis which is easy to read and important to understand. <br /> <br />Markham next turns to a discussion of some of the innovations associated with Napoleon. Now the book becomes a bit more like a traditional Dummies book, providing the reader with a ready reference to various aspects of Napoleon's contributions. Markham discusses such issues as Napoleon's military innovations, his approach to politics and governing, his economic and legal contributions, his promotion of religious freedom, his diplomacy and his contributions - intended and unintended - towards a united Europe. <br /> <br />For many people, the story of Napoleon is one of romance, and Markham does a wonderful job telling the story of Napoleon's loves. We learn of his two wives, Josephine and Marie Louise, and we also learn of Napoleon's earliest loves, his mistress in Egypt and, perhaps most romantic of all, of his Polish mistress. <br /> <br />In the tradition of Dummies books, Markham closes his discussion with several chapters in a \"Part of Tens\" section. These include interesting discussions of Napoleonic battlefields, additional references, a time line and maps. The chapter in this section that I found most interesting was the one where Markham discusses a number of pieces of advice that he would have given to Napoleon (with, of course, the great advantage of hindsight). <br /> <br />In short, if you want to read a really good book on Napoleon, or if you just want to read a really good book, I highly recommend that you try Napoleon for Dummies. <br />	2005-10-06

It shows how his upbringing had a serious impact on his decisions in the war and how he dealt with the consequences of those decisions after the war. As a child, he was given the best education according to Japanese custom. He spent most of his life away from his father and grandfather, since they were both busy men. He witnessed the glorious aftermath of the Russo-Japanese war and believed that this was the standard that should happen for the War of Greater East Asia. <br />In the war, most people perceived him as a puppet being operated by a group of military advisors. This is blatantly wrong. He played an active role in what happened and didn't happen in the war. He knew about the treatment of POW's and Chinese civilians but did little to stop this. The delay of the surrender was also his fault, as he sought a way out that would leave him and his regime intact. <br />After the war was concluded, The Japanese people felt as though they had to protect their emperor's innocence even after all that he had done. As the blame was placed on General Tojo, who accepted his death as willing as anyone else in history, and his cabinet, Hirohito escaped with no blame placed on him. The emperor then began to rebuild and recreate Japan as a peaceful nation with economic power to rival the western countries. This book is an excellent account of Hirohito's life and what influenced him to do what he did. I recommend this book to history or Japan fans so they can learn the emperor's story. <br />	2005-10-06

No, not by a long shot. Roxanne Bonaventure, with the aid of a mysterious device she calls 'the Sofia', travels backward and forward in time, visits parallel realities and chats with amazing and interesting people. Chris Roberson takes the well-worn premise of time-travel and quite litterally, turns it on it's ear. He has obviously done his homework on the subject. He structures the elements of theoretical time travel and uses them in a very real and dramatic way. This work really stretched the boundries of my understanding of the subject and yet it never reads like a text book although sometimes, the ideas take some time to wrap your brain around. Roxanne is a real, thinking, feeling, breathing human being. Her reactions to circumstances are authentically written and completely believable. She is fun and witty, sly and very intelligent. Though through all the myriad realities she visits, she finds herself more alone than before the Sofia came into her life. This element is the heart of the story. Her yearning for someone to share all this with is, at times, heartbreaking but never falls into melodramatic fluff. It's all very real. A 'What if...' in the best and truest sense.  <br /> What I also enjoyed were the pop-culture references that Roberson sprinkles through the story. From H.G. Wells to the Beatles. Great fun. I found myself wishing for a very long rainy day to just sit and read, although I also found myself wanting to savor it while it lasted.  <br /> Finally, after reading the last page of Here, There and Everywhere I found myself feeling as if I had just finished a sumptuous meal. Every course included new tastes and new textures. Every succulent morsel filling the tiniest corners. Roberson leaves no dangling plot points and his finale is like a glass of fine wine that finishes an incredible meal. One just sits back and says, 'Now, that was great'. Highly recommended.	2005-10-06
US	46523361	R22E92HC3H1MD6	0976775301	625311728	Terror at Beslan: A Russian Tragedy with Lessons for America's Schools	Books	5	11	20	N	N	"Tremendously Important Book"	When Lt. Col. Dave Grossman handed me this book in August 2005, he said, \"This is a tremendously important book.   Don't fail to read and apply it.\"   He was so right.   It is, admittedly, a gut-wrenching and difficult book to read--far from entertaining. <br /> <br />I have gone back and forth on my opinion about whether I think everyone should read it or only our warrior class.   As I got toward the end, I became convinced that every American should take a deep breath, swallow hard and dive into this book.  <br /> <br />Be prepared to have denial painfully stripped away, perhaps even shed some tears as I did.   As the author stated, \"In attempting to prepare the American psyche for the worst possible act--the taking and killing of our children-- we must all shed the veil of civility and luxury in which we conduct our lives. ... The preparation of our country is not merely the preparation of our law enforcement and military.   It is the preparation of our nation; of every man, woman and child who claims the title of 'American.'   It is the preparation of every citizen and school employee, but most importantly, of every parent across our great nation. <br /> <br />\"This is not the kind of war fought only by those valiant souls who everyday don a blue uniform bearing the Stars and Stripes on the shoulder, or who pick up an automatic rifle and shrug weary shoulders into an overloaded rucksack.   It is a war that either will be fought by all Americans, or one that will consume our nation.   For it is our very way of life that the enemy sees as evil, and is intent on destroying.   As it is, every one of us lives the American dream.   It is therefore every one of us who is a target of terrorism.   We are all, therefore--quite literally--in a fight for our lives.\"   (John Giduck, TERROR AT BESLAN, pp 277-278.) <br /> <br />The preparation needed is precisely the stripping away of denial and the psychological preparation for and understanding of the nature of the enemy weface--their commitment and resolve as well as their formidable preparations and training. <br /> <br />While the title of the book focuses on a horrific incident in Russia, there is great value in the larger mission of the book to educate and prepare the reader as well as to honor the valiant and courageous Russian Special Forces teams (Vympel and Alpha) who stormed the school in a desperate struggle to save those children. <br /> <br />You will learn of Major Andrei Velko (Vympel), who led his men into the apex of the terrorists field of fire at fleeing children in an open courtyard without any cover, and bought the children seconds with their lives.   He died at thirty years of age, never turning his body away from the hail of terrorist bullets. <br /> <br />You will read of Major Misha Kuznetsov (Vympel) who also approached the building through an open \"kill zone\" to place a table in a broken window to provide an avenue of escape for fleeing children.   He then stepped into the open to cover their escape by firing at the terrorist snipers on the second floor of the building.   He was struck in a carotid artery by a sniper's bullet, but as he bled to death--literally showering the fleeing children in his own blood as they ran past him-- he continued to fire on the murderers above him. <br /> <br />You will also read of Vympel Lt. Andrei Turkin barely out of his teens who massed children behind his back as he faced the terrorists intent on murdering them.   As his teammates worked to extricate the children from the gym, a terrorist leapt out with a hand grenade.   As he brought the grenade to his chest to pull the pin and arm it, Turkin lunged at him and held him in a bear hug, containing the grenade between them, costing both their lives, but sparing the escaping children. <br /> <br />From the stories of these brave men--members of the community of special operators around the world--you can gain some insight into the preparation that is necessary to face the evil that confronts us, and inspiration to so prepare. <br /> <br />The author effectively points out the value of our warrior culture that, despite the efforts of the wilting violets on the left, has endured throughout our history.   He reminds us that it is the so-called \"common citizen\" that \"[carries] the warrior code forward.   As a country, the United States has, in aggregate, more martial artists, boxers, wrestlers, scuba divers, mountain climbers, sky divers, shooters, extreme skiers, hunters and motorcycle riders than any other.   As though these activites--which require a warrior spirit and love of danger-- are not enough, we seem to invent more and ever more dangerous activities each day.   To this very day,   more than a quarter of a millenia later, we area people in search of the constant demands of the warrior lifestyle, forever testing ourselves, our courage and our limits.   ... This is the backbone of America...\"   (pp. 334-5) <br /> <br />In this book, we are given an unflinching view and assessment of the threats we face, the absolute need to prepare, inspiring examples of valor in the face of untold evil, and inspiring reminders that we can rise to the challenge. <br /> <br />All-in-all, I am inclined to agree with Col. Grossman.   This is a tremendously important book. <br /> <br />A couple of quotes from the book.... <br /> <br />\"This is life, and none of us are getting out of it alive.   And for most of us our deaths will be horrible, and will come long before we think we're ready.   We must decide now how we will face death when it comes.   For only through that knowledge can we then decide how we would live.\"   (John Giduck TERROR AT BESLAN, p. 329.) <br /> <br />\"The society that draws a line between its fighting men and its thinking men, will find its fighting done by fools and its thinking done by cowards.\"   Sir William Francis Butler	2005-10-06

WRONG! <br /> <br />I have never read a book with such interesting potential that was so full of so many endless, boring details. The author goes to great lengths to describe in excruciating detail every brick, every shingle, every splinter, and every nail that forms the construction of the house; in addition to every cobweb in the house's endless corridors; every page in every book that resides on every shelf in every room; and every blade of grass, every tree, each individual leaf on every tree, and every weed that surrounds The Big House, to the point where you just want to scream \"WILL YOU PLEASE GET ON WITH IT! DOES THE FAMILY MANAGE TO KEEP THE HOUSE, OR DOESN'T IT?\" <br /> <br />Unlike one other reviewer who gave up on all of this endless detail after reading 75% of the book, I forced myself to finish it because, despite all the detail, I still wanted to find out whether the family managed to hang onto the property. I won't spoil the ending by revealing it here, but future readers may want to save themselves many hours of boring toil and sweat by stopping by their local library, removing the book from the shelf, reading the last few pages to learn who keeps or does not keep the house, and then returning the book to the shelf. <br /> <br />The dust jacket of this book proudly displays a seal that proclaims the book to be a \"National Book Award Finalist,\" and the major benefit I received from wading through all that detail was the realization that if this author could manage to get this book published AND have it become a National Book Award Finalist, then I could do the same, and I have finally begun to write my own memoir that I have been meaning to get around to for the past 30 years.

But I ended up reading this book in one evening, because it answered some questions our company was facing. <br />The 7 steps are good, but the real meat was the case studies. They showed how real companies approach branding, and I liked the down to earth, practical approach. My own firm is in the process of developing a corporate brand, and this book came at a much-needed time; it showed how businesses can target other businesses without a lot of \"fluff\" (which I hate), and instead had lots of \"how it's done\" (which I like). I recommend this to anyone involved in branding for the business market.	2005-10-06

Considerably more information and pictures of penises are included than vaginas.  Also, the woman's feelings, role, and consent are ignored in the discussion of sex.  According to the book, people have sex beacuse \"the man wants to get as close to the woman as he can.\"  There is no mention of whether or not the woman wants to have sex or enjoys it.  There is also talk of the physiological changes in a man when he's having sex, but none anout the women.  And finally, lots of talk and pictures about sperm, but very little mention of the eggs role (\"semen is how you and I and all of us started\") and no pictures of an egg.  Instead it shows a picture of a sperm curling up to a heart.	2005-10-06

And this book will help you learn it.  After 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Nc3 Nf6, you will learn what to do against:<br /><br />4 a3 d5! (a Scotch Four Knights with colors reversed!)<br />4 Bc4? Nxe4! (you can also get here by trying to play a Two Knights defence with Black).<br />4 g3 (the Glek system) 4...d5 (4...Bc5 is also given a chapter)<br />4 d4 exd4 5 Nd5 (the Belgrade gambit) 5...Be7<br />4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4 Bb4 (the main line of the Scotch Four Knights)<br />4 Bb5 Nd4 (4...Bb4 is also given a chapter), the Spanish Four Knights.  Actually, Pinski shows that 4...Bd6 is also quite playable here.  One of the more unusual variations he gives here is 4...Bd6 5 g4 Bc5 6 g5, but I'd certainly much rather have Black in this position.<br /><br />Of course, this book will also help you play the Four Knights with White.  And that can come in handy, even if you play the Ruy.  When I was a beginner, decades ago, I decided to play the Exchange Ruy with White.  But the first time I tried it, it went like this:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6.  I did not want to play against the Petroff Defence, so I decided to play something I knew (since I defended against 1 e4 with 1...e5), namely the main line of the Scotch Four Knights!  3 Nc3 Nc6 4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4 Bc5 (oops, my opponent chose a rare sideline) 6 Nxc6 bxc6 7 Bd3 d6 8 0-0 and I had at least an equal game, and maybe a slight edge.  In any case, I was never in trouble and eventually won.  To my surprise, as this book relates, this exact position was reached many years later in the game Miles versus Hebden.<br /><br />In my next attempt to play the Exchange Ruy, the game went:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6. (Oh, no!  That's my beloved Berlin Defence!  I decided to avoid it with White, and try the Spanish Four Knights instead.) 4 Nc3 Bb4 5 0-0 0-0.  (Now I played a rare sideline myself, to try to get my opponent out of his book.)  6 Re1 (this move is not in Pinski's book, but it is playable) 6...d6 7 Bxc6 bxc6 8 d4 exd4.  (I was getting worried here.  If I played 9 Nxd4, Black would probably be in good shape after 9...Bxc3.  So I considered playing 9 Qxd4, but I eventually decided against it.)  9 Nxd4 Bb7 (It seems that Black got the idea of playing Bb7, c5, and Bxc3, winning my e-pawn, but he did not execute this plan very well.)  10 Bg5 (defending against this threat) 10...h6 11 Bd2 (As you will see, I am still defending against the threat.) 11...Bxc3 12 Bxc3 c5 (chasing my Knight to where I wanted to play it anyway) 13 Nf5 Bxe4?

Anyone looking to dip their toes in Aeneas' story, either as a prelude to reading the Aeneid itself or merely to acquaint themselves with this major chapter of Greco-Roman mythology, would do well to spend a few hours with Rose Williams' brief, breezy retelling of the Aeneas legend. (Note that Williams' book is not precisely an abbreviated version of the Aeneid: she begins Aeneas's story in childhood while Vergil picks up the tale in the seventh year after the fall of Troy.)<br /><br />Williams' tone throughout the book is light. In her discussion of the Trojan prince Paris, for example, who had been exposed as a baby but lived to tell about it, the author writes: \"Anyone who has read much classical mythology knows that any babe abandoned on a mountainside was always rescued by a wandering shepherd and taken home to some unfortunate shepherd's wife. Thereafter the child was reared in flowery meadows tending sheep until a little bird told him one day about his royal heritage. Whereupon he descended on his true father's palace, or what he thought was his true father's palace, usually with disastrous results.\" In Paris' case those disastrous results would include the siege and destruction of Troy, which he brought about single-handedly by stealing Helen from her jealous Greek husband--her face launching a thousand ships and all that. Williams' writing is punctuated by cute asides which almost become cloying: \"Pallas' war horse, Aethon, according to Vergil, was led in the procession with big tears rolling down his hairy cheeks. (The intelligentsia always scoffs at such statements, saying that horses do not cry in grief, or at all, for that matter. Maybe they just never encountered a horse in a lachrymose mood.)\" But for the most part the writing is very successful.<br /><br />The Labors of Aeneas includes a handful of notes and an appendix of major gods. The book might have been improved by the addition of an introduction--covering Vergil's biography, for example, the history of Rome in a nutshell--but it is not strictly necessary. Readers who are unacquainted with the book's subject matter will find that the author does a good job injecting explanatory material into her account. Her book is, in short, a well-written introduction to the world Vergil describes. Readers should find it both instructive and entertaining.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greecee writing is very successful.<br /><br />The Labors of Aeneas includes a handful of notes and an appendix of major gods.

He's definitely got skills and experience. <br /> <br />What was maddening about this book was the starry-eyed reverence, awe and humility he had for every single damn rock and cliff and farmhouse he ran across. Every stone \"spoke\" to him, every cliff called out the timeless power of the sea, every ancient monastery still had ghosts running around in it. <br /> <br />His encounters with the people of Ireland at least brought him back to the living, somewhat, but even then, he has this sense of awe for the simple farming and fishing folk that, I'm sorry, just gets old after a while. He talks about visiting a pub on one stop, and being both exhilirated and driven to tears in the same song. Really? Call me a cynic, but Chris might want to adjust his meds. <br /> <br />I came away from this book thinking one of two things: Either Chris' \"book\" persona is a some ideal that he has in his head of what a serious \"writer\" and traveler should be... and that there are other bits of his character that for one reason or another he chose not to share. Like a sense of humor, perhaps. <br /> <br />Or this book really is a deep, honest, view into this guy's psyche. In which case, he sounds tedious, pretentious and boring.	2005-10-06

It had been seven years since Richard disappeared with Emma, and Susan had just about giving up ever hearing what happened.  Then a sheriff called to say the SUV had been located under a train tresle with his body but an empty infant seat in the back.   <br /> <br />\"Monday's child is fair of face; <br />Tuesday's child is full of grace; <br />Wednesday's child is full of woe; <br />Thursday's child has far to go. <br />Friday's child is loving and giving;  <br />Saturday's child works hard for its living; <br />But the child born on the Sabbath day <br />  Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.\" <br /> <br />Jeremiah in the Old Testament used to be my favorite prophet because he was called the prophet of doom.  Perhaps, like Emma, I had been a Wednesday child.  We are the survivors.  Maybe 'woeful' leaves a bad connotation, but it doesn't necessarily mean hopeless. <br /> <br />Richard had been killed before the vehicle was pushed into the water at a curve, where such accidents occur occasionally.  Emma had survived and eventually with the persistence of Susan was found.  They both lead a better, brighter life that that with Richard, as he was unreliable, and it was thought that he might have had another woman. <br /> <br />This is a \"gripping tale of tension-filled romance and heart-stopping suspense.\"  Gayle Wilson has written DOUBLE BLIND and TAKE NO PRISONERS.

Brands should be given credit for presenting the man as he was. <br /> <br />Most of us with any sense of American History know that Jackson routed the British in the last major military engagement of the War of 1812 - the Battle of New Orleans, fought actually two weeks after the war ended. Most of us know what a capable and determined President he was, Professor Brands sheds light on the things that we either do not know or know little about. <br /> <br />For example: <br /> <br />Thanks to Andrew Jackson, we have a Bank of America but NOT a Bank of the United States! There was actually a national bank whose power became too all-consuming. Jackson closed that bank, allowing open competition to flourish.  <br /> <br />Jackson was extremely popular not just as a war hero, but as a common man - reared on the then-frontier of the Carolinas and Tennessee, rough sown territories where men would settle accounts by duels, where children were often the product of illegitimate relations, and where hate of the Indians and of Blacks flourished. Jackson was a product of the backwoods, shared many of their prejudices, and tended to alienate friends as much as he did foes. For example, Davey Crockett was a valued scout and soldier in Jackson's war against the Creeks - and a friend to boot. That friendship ended when Jackson cruelly chose to force the expulsion of peaceful Cherokees along with the Creeks to the Oklahoma territory. The then Whig Congressman Crockett stood firmly and bravely against President Jackson's \"Treaty of Tears\" policies - and ended up ousted by Jackson's cronies in the following election. Crockett of course is better known for his subsequent death at the Alamo than for his gallant stand against Jackson's anti-Indian policies in Congress. <br /> <br />Another friend who had unease over Jackson's hate of Indians was Sam Houston, who actually went to live with the Cherokees following the scandal thaterupted over his wife's desertion of him when he was governor of Tennessee. But Houston chose political expediency over standing up to Jackson, and kept mum - and in Andy's good graces. <br /> <br />Jackson's hate of Indians came out of his hate of the British, who killed members of his family, indirectly caused his mother's death tending to American prisoners-of-war on a British prison ship (she took ill and died due to exposure and neglect), and his own experience as a teenager when refusing to shine the boots of a British officer was slashed almost to the bone by the officer's sword in the bitter, backwoods fighting in the Carolinas. But fighting armed warriors is one thing; expelling peaceful citizens is quite another, as well as defying the Supreme Court's Chief Justice John Marshall who sought to prevent the Cherokee expulsions. In one of his more infamous statements, Jackson asserted that \"John Marshall made the law. Now let him enforce it\". Of course a modern day President might have faced impeachment, but not Andrew Jackson.  <br /> <br />Jackson also held the Racist views of his time - promising, then going back on his word, the freedom of slaves who fought alongside American soldiers in the Battle of New Orleans. As a Southerner and Slaveowner, Jackson was sympathetic to the States' Rights of the South - but to his everlasting credit, he did put the preservation of the Union first over territorial rights, and was willing, as Professor Brands notes in much of the book, to stand firm and even threaten the South with military force. His main antagonist during the 1832 secession crisis was not only another old friend but his own then-Vice President, John C. Calhoun, who favored secession - and stood down when Jackson threatened to send Winfield Scott and the United States Army down to Charleston. <br /> <br />Jackson's firmness prevented South Carolina from seceding in 1832, and in doing so, kept the rest of the South in line. But his pro-south policies otherwise, including his fervent wish for the annexation of Texas would only mean trouble ahead for the future and weak Presidents such as Pierce and Buchanan. <br /> <br />As one reviewer stated, Professor Brands does not have the narrative gifts of a David McCullough. In fact, his \"T.R.\" bio came up far short to McCullough's biography of Roosevelt's early years - \"Mornings on Horseback\". But he does give us an excellent biography of Jackson that does give us a full picture of the man - and does include the Racist and mean-spirited warts and all.	2005-10-05

At the time this book came into my hands, I was 19 years old and in excruciating all-over joint pain from the rheumatoid arthritis I'd had since aged nine. I was bed-ridden at the time and hardly wanting to eat but I started the diet recommended in the book and within three weeks I was pain free and have remained so. I went on to become a journalist and mother. I only wish that I had had this book as a resource when I was nine and those awful years of pain and joint damage could have been avoided. I am totally grateful to the author of this book and highly recommend it to those searching for arthritis self-help knowledge.	2005-10-05

This is a real organization, dedicated to the discovery and study of shipwreck artifacts, as well as a fictional one. The fictional NUMA is a kind of super special operations agency solving crises at sea. The word \"swashbuckling\" comes up a lot.    This adventure centers on the work of Laszlo Kovacs, a brilliant Hungarian inventor and scientist whose work developing an electromagnetic interference device for the Nazis to use as a weapon was interrupted when the Russians invaded at the end of the war. A group of neo-anarchists, bent on destroying the World Bank and other institutions of world order, has rediscovered his theories and plans to develop their own interference weapon to hold the world hostage. If this technology is directed at the earth's magnetic poles, the resulting chain reactions would destroy the planet.    A trial of the magnetic interference technology wreaks all sorts of havoc at sea, including a rogue pod of killer whales and a gigantic whirlpool, drawing the attention of NUMA's crack team. They soon learn that the secret to Kovacs's work --- and how to stop it --- may be in the hands of Kovacs's unwitting granddaughter, busy with her own totally unrelated research concerning woolly mammoths. The race is on! Who will get to the granddaughter first?    A certain suspension of disbelief is required, but readers who know and love Clive Cussler's work should have no trouble obliging. He's not a fancy writer --- for instance, you'll get no more attempts at characterization than a job description, a wardrobe description, and eye color --- but by page 40, flashbacks to World War II have shown us Professor Kovacs's escape from assassination, a cargo ship has been sucked down to the bottom of the sea, and our hero, Kirk Austin, has faced a killer whale on his kayak. POLAR SHIFT sets a course for adventure, and if you're in the mood for a little escapism, you'll enjoy thevoyage.    (...)	2005-10-05

Dan is no writer, and that fact is PAINFULLY obvious. Worse, the information presented contradicts in parts what Mike Austin and Mike Dunaway (Austin's pupil) have publicly stated about the swing in other reference materials. One example is that Mr. Dunaway states that the delayed action of the swing is the squaring of the clubface, whereas Mr. Shauger claims that the club stays square throughout the swing. My experience is that keeping the club square throughout the swing reduces power. This finding can be substantiated by physics. Nonetheless, I have worked with these ideas for several months, and the concepts are interesting once they are interpreted and understood. These concepts are not new, and this type of swing is covered in some detail in other materials (such as \"Search for the Perfect Swing: The Proven Scientific Approach to Fundamentally Improving Your Game by Alastair Cochran\"). I have found that slight mistakes with this swing are greatly amplified. I have also found that with the grip espoused by Mr. Shauger (left thumb extended straight down the top of the shaft) I cannot feel the position of the club head very effectively at all. I have also found that distance control is difficult to achieve with this swing, and fat shots are very easy to come by. This stands to reason since the basis for the swing is a lofting of the clubface through impact. That's right! Through impact, add loft to the club. Good advice? No. Several months of study have convinced me that this is a good swing if I want to spend time searching in the woods for lost balls. Does it add power? For the average golfer, yes. Are there other ways of achieving the same kind of power? Yes. There are an infinite number of variations of the golf swing. Many of these enable me to swing a club at 130 mph. This is one variation, and I do not believe it to be an optimal one.	2005-10-05
US	50714912	R344M20E35G58Y	1931236488	729114364	In Ordinary Time	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Rice Krispies and soft summer	If you think of the lines and words of prose as a screen, there are two ways of looking at the lines and words of prose. You can either focus on the screen or the view out of the screen. Prose can be seen as either basket weaving (an experience unto itself) or as a window (a means to a new experience.) These two modes of writing fiction are so entrenched in contemporary writing that readers tend not to think about them. Self-consciously literary readers would say they are drawn to a book because they read for characters. A reader for character is excited by the intimate detail in prose where there is time for the characters to trim their nails and inspect the collected dirt and dried skin. To get to know a fictional someone changes how we know other people in the world. The other type of reader can't get past the fact that these so called people in a book are really just gatherings of words. They are excited by a fresh turn of phrase, a way of saying something that changes how we know the world through language.<br /><br />The second section of Sharon Mesmer's new collection of stories, In Ordinary Time, is told in the first person. It is a series of stories about a young woman who grows up in the cracks like a weed in the sidewalk in a poor neighborhood in Chicago. The author, Mesmer, grew up in Chicago. The reader wonders, \"Is this really real?\" And in asking the question the reader reads for character.<br /><br />The narrator in this section of the book deals with a lot of things: record collections and a childhood house stuffed litter. Mesmer's lyrical catalogue of junk reminded me of Isaac Babel's early stories about growing up in Odessa. \"Everything impressed itself vigorously on my soul,\" Babel wrote in his story \"Childhood.\" \"If people talked in my presence about a ship, I remembered the sign board, the shabby gold letters, the scratch on its left corner.\" Objects in these stories become less things -- two brown lunch bags, in Mesmer's story for instance, with rubber bands containing a deck of old occasional cards -- but lost emotion. Where a cookie might contain a smell that triggers a Proustian reverie, junk in Mesmer's fiction becomes a concrete representation of old emotion. Junk is old emotion. Mesmer evokes loss when these old associations can't be attached to the piles of trash. Mesmer writes:<br /><br />I dig deeper in the trunk and find Marie's and my kid clothes. [...] Looking at those photos of my family I am able to recall moments that I'd forgotten or that I thought were dreams. The particular aura of those times comes back, too, but fleetingly, and I can't hang on to it all.<br /><br />It is in these innocuous cairns of trash where Mesmer begins to bend naturalism to her linguistic purpose. In the final full story, the thinly-veiled autobiographical narrator is left to clean out her parents home after her mother assumes the Paxil nirvana of a rest home. Naturalism boils off and we are left with the alkali crust of concrete language:<br /><br />When I turn on the light for the first time I can see it's just as horrible as I imagined it would be: the walls are spray-painted with \"AMBROSE\" graffiti, the reading chair that I set up for myself when M and Dad first moved in is buried under the beer cans and plastic pop bottles, and the floor is strewn with ripped curtains, carpets, tablecloths and sheet sets, the result of Maria and her boyfriend rifling through the trunks for stuff to sell for drugs.<br /><br />At the other polarity to naturalism is a kind of deliberately artificial writing, something that depends on the logic of language rather than evoking the perceived world. In my ignorance of various \"isms,\" I'll call it \"syntacticism\" as opposed to realism. Where the realistic story tries to pass itself off as a life lived rather a deliberate construction, the syntactical story revels in the effect of language to make meaning from nothing. Naturalism expects language to serve meaning. Syntactical storiesexpect language to create meaning.<br /><br />In the first section of the book, the author constantly reminds the reader they are reading a book made of words. In the first story, a trapeze artist is described, \"everyone loved her, and then more than ever because of her failure, which amplified her innocence. She was never, of course, innocent. She was pure evil. But to her audience she was the Mexican Shirley Temple.\" Here we find allegories, twist ending, and the repeated appearance of a legendary band of bandit aphorists. They assault travelers with saying, such as \"The pollen of the morning glory is stores in five tiny boxes.\" The aphorism, as a clot of language easily separated from its sense, is the distillation of this mode of writing. In one story, Eucharis banishes St. Brave and aphorists terrorizing the land. Eucharis achieves a degree of comfort with confusion. \"It was left to Eucharis to decide exactly how what had transpired was in fact revelation.\"<br /><br />While it is exciting to see these two modes laid side-by-side, I couldn't help but compare how adept Mesmer was with both styles. She is skilled and droll with the syntactical story. But the contrivances of the syntactical stories found in \"Armistice with History,\" felt oddly out of place along-side the stark, painful, seeming-honest (who knows how real?) stories found \"In Ordinary Time.\" However the first section of the book trains a reader to read plain language closely. And with an ear trained in this way, Mesmer's realistic stories uncover the naked syntax of everyday life. \"On every page,\" the narrator says, \"there's a shopping lists, all variations on a theme: Vienna sausage, stew meat, veal sausage, milk, bread, Lotto, Rice Krispies, soft summer, Lady Bugs or 3 Ninjas, pop for Nick.\"ical stories expect language to create meaning.  <br /> <br />In the first section of the book, the author constantly reminds the reader they are reading a book made of words.

What if we could communicate with each other simply by thinking about it?  I try that all the time but I don't know if it works.  Now, researchers have developed techniques to connect a human's mind to robots and computers across the Internet.  Using brain implants to restore motion to the paralyzed and sight to blind people allow some patients to control robots (and computers) simply by thinking about it!    'Serenity' is closer to the truth, though based in 2046, with the behavior modification used on rebellious recruits.  It gave power and strength to a skinny little girl, River, with fighting skills of a giant.  I saw the tallest man I ever did see at the post office the other morning, and it was scary seeing how long and skinny his legs were.    Is it good to alter our minds?  I've watched the hypnotist at the fair make \"normal\" volunteers from the group watching act silly and do ridiculous things.  I had decided that he'd hypotized them with his melodious, deep voice, as his personality was not spectacular.    Labs worldwide are dabbling with cloning, stem cell research, and genetic engineering as shown so clearly in the movie, 'The Island,' craeting ethical dilemmas as to the \"rightness\" to change people in this manner.  The United States of America have imposed severe limits on government funding for stem cell research, but have left the private sector to do what it wants.  Though embryonic stem cell science got its start in the States, the rest of the world is fighting to take the lead.    We were not granted life extensions, which may be possible in the future, but at what cost?  Will it make life better for the \"altered\" or will it turn them into robots as in 'The Stepford Wives\"?  Bodies are flexible; by contrast, \"our computers are simple, rigid, specialized things.  An e-mail program will never learn to handle voice-mail, despite the similarity between the two.\"  Voice mail is available on some of the Internet carriers now, but you would need a new, energized system with plenty of memory space.    Should we fear change?  Ramaz Naam doesn't think so.  Thanks to him, I am able to use Internet Explorer to clear out the junk in my daily computing so this old computer will go another day.

Sebald Images by Tess Jaray	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Memories and Deep Impressions	In 1999 the late and greatly lamented WG Sebald collaborated with his admirer, artist Tess Jaray, to match each other's influence in producing twenty-three short poems each with an accompanying 'visualization'.  The result is FOR YEARS NOW and while this may not bring new fans to those who love Sebald's 'novels', the book is beautiful reading.<br /><br />Though Sebald taught in the UK and was wholly bilingual, his books were written in his native German.  This short book of poetry is a significant diversion in that the poems were written in English.  The subjects are like brief thoughts, mostly suffused with Sebald's signature melancholy and rather disappointed view of the universe he strolled. 'Please send me/ the brown coat/ the one I used/ to wear on/ my night journeys.'  Incandescent moments, minimal words, yet each with Jaray's abstract illustrations makes a significant impact.<br /><br />Simple though this short book is, it is further proof that Sebald was one of our more important writers who died far too young.

I for one know of drug companies and their giving of gifts to physicians, including even free vacations by the M.D.'s endorsement and potential future prescribing usage of their products-to you and I \"the patients\". <br />I have seen microwave popcorn with the drug companies logo emblazoned on it, pens, clocks, pencils, paper, memo pads, desk organizers, calendars, bulletin boards, erase boards, koozies, plastic cups, coffee cups, letter openers, magnets and the list goes on. <br />I have not yet purchased the book, then again, I do not take any prescription drugs at this time. I will be purchasing this book today though, because I feel that Mr. Trudeau is caught in a web of corruption, and needs as many of us to support what he is doing-for someone to finally tell the truth about drug companies. <br />As far as the price of the book, unless Mr. Trudeau is a wealthy man, I do not imagine he would print it for free, and is ENTITLED for his research, time and effort to receive a stipend for his work. <br />As far as his website charging a fee to join, how ELSE will he be able to reveal WHAT HE CAN NOT HAVE IN PRINT IN HIS BOOK, LESS HE BE SUBJECT TO CENSORSHIP/INCARCERATION FOR PRINTING IT PUBLIC?? As I have heard him mention in his infomercial, THANK GOD FOR THE INTERNET, if he is manning the website, and putting the information on the site and doing the research of the information, ISN'T he entitled to receive a \"fee\" for doing so? If he saves JUST ONE LIFE-MAYBE YOUR MOTHER, FATHER, BROTHER, wouldn't it be WORTH it then? <br />Think about that. <br />Also, as a nurse in a nursing home, I have complained to state officials, government officials and even the President on the WASTES OF MEDICATIONS IN NURSING HOMES, AND ALL HAS FELL ON DEAF EARS. <br />If a patient is admitted to a nursing home, and say they are on 10 meds, we order them from the pharmacy and they ususually come in a one month supply. <br />You know the costs of these meds, I am sure, the common ones for nursing home residents are in these categories: <br />1. Diabetes <br />2. Arthritis <br />3. High blood pressure <br />4. Arrhythmias of the heart. <br />5. Congestive heart failure. <br />6. Stroke (cva) <br />These are just to name a few. I am sure anyone out there that has had to buy any of the meds in the above categories, KNOWs THE COSTS. <br />Ok, so the patient comes in on day one, 10 meds of 30 day supply are sent. Say on the fifth day the patient: <br />1. dies <br />2. tranferred to another facility <br />3. doctor prescribes different dose or med. <br />In all the above cases, you would think that since the meds are packaged in \"bubble\" cards with each pill/dose individually protected from tampering, or touching them, that the pharmacy would take them back for credit to our medicaid/medicare system, and to reuse them? <br />THE ANSWER IS NO. <br />ALL MEDICATIONS ARE DESTROYED, USUSALLY BY INCINERATION, SOME BY WITNESSING OF STAFF -ONE RN AND ONE PHARMACIST CONSULTANT-FLUSHING DOWN THE COMMODE. <br />So, imagine, the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS DESTROYED JUST BY NURSING HOMES EACH MONTH, YES, EACH MONTH.

Emma Holly has managed to make an extremely appealing and unique race of bloodrinkers. They are sexy, sensitive and intelligent. The only problem for them is exactly how long they really live. The sad truth of their lives is that so few beings have the stamina for immortality.  <br />The upyr were worried about Lucious. The world seemed to mean nothing to him. He was merely existing with no attachment to the world other than his companion Edmund, a younger upyr.  A chance encounter with a dying man on the road leads Lucious to an important turning point.  He assumes the identity of this man, and is thrust back into the world of the living where he meets Theo Beckett. <br />Theo was a wonderful female character. She was supporting her family and being a good sister and all the time not really understanding what was missing in her life until she meets Lucious. She has lived her whole life in the shadow of her older, but very loving and supportive sister, Caroline.  Theo and Lucious have a series of intimate encounters that force Lucious, out of guilt, to wipe them from her mind. He then resolves to try to win her love like a human man.  She ends up thinking that she dreamed the intimacies with him, and is very confused by her feelings about a man that she initially wanted for her sister.   There is never any doubt though who he really wants.  <br />This was a truly satisfying story. I have said this before, but I really like a story where the two main characters can at least admit to themselves that they want each other. You know there will be difficulties, but the strength of their bond is true.  <br />	2005-10-04

Though the prose simplifies Shakespeare's complex iambic pentameter verses, it does not change the spirit of the stories or soften the calamity in Shakespeare's famous tragedies. The stories retold are \"Twelfth Night\", \"Macbeth\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"The Taming of the Shrew\", \"The Tempest\", \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"Hamlet\", \"The Merchant of Venice\", \"As You Like It\", and \"The Winter's Tale\".

I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />The story is constructed on a wonderful frame and decorated with engaging, careful writing.  It is a highly embellished, almost rococo story; anyone seeking the distilled prose style of a JM Coetzee will be unhappy.  The author gives voice to adolescents, especially, in a full and thorough way.  She respects her young characters and does not create glossy caricatures of youths, as so many authors do. <br /> <br />Other reviewrs here have complained that the author has a poorly tuned ear for American slang, gives inaccurate descriptions of black body colors and does a bad job of describing physical traits.  I can only say that none of these things appeared to me to be a problem.  I much admire the way her characters adjusted their speech and deportment according to their shifting milieus. Particularly with regard to descriptions of middle aged bodies and the way they work, I was on board.  And as a 56 year old woman with many same-age intimate friends, I think I am on safe ground here. <br /> <br />My only complaint about this book: God bless your young heart, Zadie Smith; middle-aged academics and others are a lot more nuanced and occult than you now know.  The story from Howard's and Kiki's perspectives does not quite ring true.  The writing has the mildly snide acerbity typically heard among slightly insecure graduate students.  The author will improve in this area with more years on her.   <br /> <br />The author is a wonderful observer and chronicler of humans, especially young ones.   I look forward to many more witty, kindhearted, trenchant stories.  It is a joy to watch this talent develop.	2005-10-04

Simply put, it tells the story of Rachel, a young girl struggling to break free of the ties that bind her (similar to Naomi Ragen's Jephte's Daughter but without Ms. Ragen's depth of character).

She was a happy homemaker who seemed to have it all-a devoted husband and obedient children, a sparkling home that was the talk of the town, a fashion sense to die for, and far more than her fair share of women's intuition.\" - From the instruction book<br /><br />The Housewives Tarot is a hilarious domestic divination kit that comes in an attractive \"recipe\" box. The recipe dividers separate the Major Arcana, Minor Arcana, and the instruction book. If that's not amusing enough, there are actual recipes on the back of these dividers, including Divinated Eggs and Ice Box Fortune Cake.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of 50's d&eacute;cor and I assumed this deck was a mere novelty.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />While some of the montages are laugh-out-loud hilarious in presentation, there is a kernel of truth in each depiction. For example, The Magician sports slicked-back hair (I can practically *smell* the Bryl-cream!), toothy grin, and smarmy wide-eyes-while his hand gesture proclaims \"tada!\"...referring to a sparkling new (or is it?) washing machine.<br /><br />A huckster salesman. Now if that isn't a darn good rendering of The Magician...! And how many of you considered that The Magician could embody the sycophant archetype? It never occurred to me until I got my hands on this deck!<br /><br />The Housewives Tarot provided several other \"epiphanies\", which surprised and delighted me-in large part to the brief, clever interpretations for domestic metaphors. In addition, the 96-paged instruction booklet provides 3 keywords for each card, a brief interpretation (upright only), and five spreads (including \"The Dinette\").<br /><br />Some of my favorite cards in this deck are:<br /><br />Death - Depicted by rancid mayonnaise crawling with flies, an \"expired\" timer, and rotten half of tomato. The label? \"Real Salmonella. Everything Expires\" (complete with skull, cross bones, and roses!).<br /><br />Justice - A perfectly coiffed mother-looking like a young Elizabeth Taylor-has her son turned over her knee, ready to spank him with a wooden spoon. She wears a mischievous grin, the boy looks like his mouthing the words \"help!\", and his lollipop goes flying out if his hand. An interesting take on \"what goes around comes around\"!<br /><br />The Hermit - A woman soaks luxuriously in a large tub, several bars of soap surrounding her. Need I say more?<br /><br />The Devil - A long-legged chocolate cake holds a cigarette in one hand and martini in the other. She's surrounded by a can of \"Spork\", instant coffee, a pack of cigarettes, Redi-Cheez, TV dinner, and a bottle of Valium.<br /><br />Knight of Pentacles - A smiling, tuxedoed young man holding on to the handle of a shiny red lawnmower.<br /><br />My husband, who's not a Tarot reader (yet!), thinks The Housewives Tarot is utterly hysterical. His personal favorite is the 2 of Swords: a blindfolded woman about to carve a turkey. Interestingly, we both put this deck through its paces-doing readings for each other. He was able to \"read\" these cards easily and gave me some accurate, interesting insight. Likewise, I was able to do the same for his particular question.<br /><br />The cards of the Major Arcana are trimmed in a black/red motif, while the borders of the Minors are depicted thusly:<br /><br />Pentacles - Pea green<br />Swords - Red<br />Wands - Tan<br />Cups - Aquamarine<br /><br />The backs are fully reversible, featuring a red and cream tartan design and have a matte finish.<br /><br />While some of the interpretations in the instruction book-often peppered with name-brand items like Calgon, General Foods International Coffee and TV Guide-may seem cheesy on first glance, the meanings given are surprisingly ingenious.<br /><br />While I loved this deck as soon as I opened it, I had no idea that I'd actually be able to *read* with it! And to show that you don'thave to be Tarot-adept to read with The Housewives Tarot, my husband can read with it, too!<br /><br />Fans of the June Cleaver era will absolutely love The Housewives Tarot. However, as I said, you don't need to have an interest in this era to enjoy this deck and use it skillfully. Those looking for a fun, non-threatening deck to use with clients will find a jewel here-without sacrificing accuracy or incisiveness.<br /><br />(Note: I discovered that there were two 10 of Wands card in my deck, and that I was missing the 8 of Wands card.

And The Lincoln Lawyer is no exception.

And he's not necessarily concerned whether his clients are innocent or not.<br /><br />A wealthy Beverly Hills realtor is arrested for attacking a woman in her home. This type of client is what Mick Haller calls a 'franchise case.' It's a big payday and the case appears to be an easy one. But after someone close to Mick is murdered, things become murky before they clear up. Mick is facing down pure evil and he'd better be at the top of his game if he wishes to get out of this case alive.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: The Lincoln Lawyer has everything; great characters, scintillating plot, action, evil, gritty issues, ex-wives and a hero who is unlikely.

Then Geisler and Turek start to show their true colors by showing their complete lack of understanding of the theory of evolution. I don't have a problem if they disagree with the theory or reject it, but they should have the intellectual honesty to represent the facts of evolution honestly. I will focus on chapter five and show Geisler and Turek's mistakes and distortions of evolution, and make a brief mention of other chapters.<br /><br />In chapter five they lump both atheists and Darwinists in the same boat, and use them interchangeably as if a Darwinists was a synonym for atheist which it isn't. Many Darwinists happen to be both Christians and Darwinists. In Chapter five the claim is made that the theory of evolution posits that man descended from apes, this is not true. Darwinists only say that both man and apes descended from a common ancestor which no longer exists. So this is just wrong and a misinterpretation of the facts. In Chapter five they also talk about the first life and its complexity. In the same breath Geisler and Turek mention the first life and DNA. I am sorry but the first forms of life didn't self replicate using DNA, but only RNA DNA hadn't evolved at that stage. Geisler and Turek make the claim that ALL life was encoded using DNA which just isn't true i.e. the previous sentence. Geisler and Turek go on to explain the \"specified complexity\" of DNA. What Geisler and Turek fail to mention which I find very germane to the topic is that a lot of DNA is \"junk\" DNA. Geisler and Turek are after all trying to show through the complexity of DNA that human life is designed by God. Why then don't they mention that about 97% of the DNA in the human genome is junk DNA? Given that fact it makes you wonder if life was truly designed. Geisler and Turek then go on to argue that Richard Dawkins says that a primitive amoeba's DNA code (real scientists use genome instead of DNA code) would fill 1,000 complete sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica. They make the FALSE claim that Evolutionists can't explain this using natural law. Now if Geisler or Turek EVEN took the time to read Dawkins book the \"Blind Watchmaker\" they wouldn't be saying this or if they have read it they have grossly misunderstood it. Geisler and Turek say scientists rule out intelligence which isn't true either they just have a better explanation. If intelligence were involved I would ask HOW exactly, and challenge either Geisler or Turek to explain EXACTLY how. Did a big hand or force come out of the sky and design life? I want to know HOW, not just that intelligence had something to do with it. Scientists have found no need to introduce intelligence into the process because they have shown HOW natural law by itself can create life. Why complicate the issue. Occam's razor applies here. If all things are equal usually the simplest explanation is the right one.<br /><br />Turek and Geisler go on to make the false claim that evolutionist know beyond any doubt how life came into existence. Darwinists don't, the theory of evolution hasn't evolved (no pun intended) to the point of understanding the origins of life perfectly. There is no sin in not knowing something. Geisler and Turek say because evolutionists can't show through experiment how life came from non living matter that they are wrong. This is absurd just because you can't show how something is done doesn't mean that your hypothesis is wrong it just shows that it hasn't been proven yet. Even if early life came from God this doesn't refute Darwin's theory. They are the ones claiming that there is a rival theory of evolution to Darwin's called theistic evolution. This has nothing to do with whether you think that evolution as evolutionists understand it was started by God. As I mentioned earlier you can be a Darwinist and believe in God. Turek and Geisler are the ones that are attacking Darwin's theory. God could have set evolution in motion where evolutionists take umbrage is claiming that after evolution was set in motion that God intervened in the process. Once set in motion evolution can be fully explained by natural law that has nothing to do with God. While we are on this topic we could make the same claim that Turek and Geisler make regarding evolutionists claim that life comes from lifeless matter. We can apply Geisler's Road Runner Tactic and say since religionists can't prove that life came from God they must be wrong and life has to have come from lifeless matter. The same logic applies to them.<br /><br />If we knew everything, science wouldn't have anything to discover. Just because you can't explain something doesn't mean God did it. In ancient times man didn't understand rain and thunder so attributed it to a rain god. Today we have a scientific explanation, just because science hasn't found an answer doesn't mean there isn't one or that God did it. It just means we have more to learn. People like Turek and Geisler love to fill in the gaps of science with God. If science were left up to them we still would believe lightening and rain were caused by a rain god. Unlike religion, science is a work in progress and doesn't claim to have absolute knowledge. Before the reader points out the authors objections to the God of Gaps fallacy. Let me just say their objections to the God of Gaps fallacy are self defeating because their objections are based off the God of Gaps fallacy its self. The reason, is that there objections are based on false premises. The first false premise is that we have empirical evidence of intelligent design.  That is false we don't have evidence for intelligent design, which in turn are based off false premises sorry Turek and Geisler. The premises for intelligent design are ironically arrived at by God Gaps argument. Geisler and Turek arrive at their premises by way of God Gaps saying because science doesn't have an explanation for the first cell it must be God where is the evidence Geisler that is was God? Appearance of design? I am sorry but appearance of design isn't design, and your \"take out the garbage mom\" argument isn't analogous in the same way your Mount Rushmore argument isn't which I explain below. Turek and Geisler second objection is just false; Darwinists never claimed that Intelligent Design wasn't open to natural explanations. Darwinists were arguing against the intelligence part not the natural part. Turek and Geisler third objection that the theory of intelligent design is falsifiable isn't an objection at all because it's been falsified and disproved if it's truly based on whether natural law can account for specified complexity which it can. Finally Turek and Geisler last objection is just plain false. Darwinists have accounted for irreducible complexity. Maybe Turek and Geisler just haven't sat down and taken the time to truly understand the theory of evolution. Who can blame them, it's a lot of work and they have more important things to do like writing this book.<br /><br />Geisler and Turek then go on to compare Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon with evolution. If we apply the Principle of Uniformity to this analogy it doesn't follow that life was the product of intelligence. Geisler and Turek have wrongly flipped the Principle of Uniformity on its head. There is nothing wrong in comparing the Grand Canyon to Mount Rushmore, but there is a problem in comparing Mount Rushmore to life. I will first explain Geisler and Turek's comparison of Mount Rushmore to the Grand Canyon. Geisler and Turek say that in the past formations such a Mount Rushmore were made by intelligent beings, so we can conclude similar formations were intelligently designed; this is an example of Principle of Uniformity.  The Principle of Uniformity postulates that the laws of nature discovered in one field of science apply uniformly over all of science, that precedents that are set in one part of science can be applied to other areas of science. We can apply the Principle of Uniformity to the Grand Canyon which was formed from soil erosion, because similar formations have been observed being created by soil erosion, and that the Grand Canyon wasn't created by intelligence, but by natural principals of geology.  But this analogy has nothing to do with life or evolution. That is what misleading about it.<br /><br />Geisler and Turek falsely compare this analogy to the theory of evolution. This is an example logical error called a false analogy. Life is in a completely different class of phenomenon than Mount Rushmore. Mount Rushmore has a precedent showing it was intelligently created, where as if we apply the principles of evolution to the life it can be shown that intelligence didn't have anything to do with it. Evolution also demonstrates how it is possible to give the appearance of design where there is none. I am sorry Geisler and Turek but the appearance of design doesn't mean something was designed. There is a big difference.  Now if they compared the Grand Canyon to life they might have something, both were created by nature and not intelligence. This is why I said that Geisler and Turek have flipped the Principle of Uniformity on its head. Comparing life to Mount Rushmore is erroneous. There is no precedent showing life was created intelligently so the principle of Uniformity doesn't apply in this case. Geisler and Turek are comparing apples to oranges life is something completely different than Mount Rushmore. It's this kind of misunderstanding that plagues \"I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist.\" In the next chapter they talk about microevolution and macroevolution. Turek and Geisler say that macroevolution is impossible that is that a species evolves into another species. Again this is just wrong. I don't have enough room to go into this Talk Origins gives 29 plus examples of macroevolution. If you're interested type 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution into Google and the first result will lead you to their page.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on and on until this review was 100 pages long and not even get close to Geisler and Turek lack of understanding and distortion of the facts to support their theory of intelligent design or theistic evolution. Now if Turek, Geisler were even attempting to offer HONEST evidence why they thought the theory of evolution is wrong they would have addressed the evidences I have presented. They not only fail to do this they change mislead and DISTORT the theory of evolution to support their mistaken idea of how God made the universe. If you're a Christian and want to reconcile it with the theory of Evolution you would be better served by \"Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution\" by Kenneth Miller.od where is the evidence Geisler that is was God?

That pulled me into the novel, and then I was gone on this dense, fascinating journey through the tortured but often joyous souls of these lonely, confused boys who take such solace in music, comics and other pop entertainment.

The letdown of a finish certainly can't be attributed to a lack of talent on the part of the story's creative team.     Rocker-director-comic book writer Rob Zombie is a sort of ghoulish Renaissance Man whose work in a variety of media is heavily influenced by 70s-era horror flicks.  Richard Corben is a certified artistic genius who ranks with such greats as Neal Adams, Jim Steranko, John Byrne, and Alex Ross as a living legend among comic book artists.   Then there's the comics' world's answer to Stephen King, Steve Niles (\"30 Days of Night\").   Niles is so prolific that during any given week it seems that there are at least 337 horror comic titles hitting shelves that he has written.    \"Bigfoot\" collects the four-part mini series that was published earlier this year by IDW Publishing.   The storyline seems, at first, deceptively simple.   While vacationing in Shadow Hills, National Park a young boy is forced to watch in horror as his parents and family dog are brutally murdered by the legendary sasquatch.   Years later, when a series of mysterious killings in that same park make headlines, the now grown boy must return and face the monster once and for all.    \"Bigfoot\" is a good, fast-paced read.   For older readers it will bring back fond memories of watching B-movies like \"The Crater Lake Monster\" and \"The Legend of Boggy Creek\" in the grindhouse theatres of a bygone era.   Corben rarely disappoints and his artwork here is first rate.   Many panels make great use of shading and movement particularly in nighttime and action scenes.   As for Zombie, anyone who has seen \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" or \"The Devil's Rejects\" knows that restraint isn't his strong suit.   But the pairing with Niles apparently got him to reign in some of his baser impulses.   \"Bigfoot\" is violent and gory but only when and where it needs to be.    Unfortunately, after a strong start the storyline sputters to a disappointing conclusion.   A frequent complaint about Niles is that he writes great stories that he doesn't know how to finish.   Working with Zombie didn't keep that from happening here.   The final showdown between man and monster just doesn't have the big payoff it ought to.      Bottom line:  \"Bigfoot\" is a good read but it falls short of being a masterpiece.	2005-10-04

Finally a guidebook on Las Vegas that has very comprehensive unbiased reports on hotels, casinos and restaurants. There is a simple rating and quality system they have devised to make searching for a hotel much easier, and it screams of exceptionally detailed and well researched data. There is an excellent blend of restaurants reviewed and rated including the better buffets in town. The writers are quick to point out the places that are targetted towards locals as well as tourists, which will give any reader good alternatives to the very high tourist-based strip & downtown places. Excellent coverage is given to the production & lounge shows - most importantly, it will make your decision which Cirque de Soleil show to see based on your tastes (and budget). For the golfer, a superb guide and rating system of the courses in and around Vegas will make teeing off a breeze, and for fitness freaks, both hotel and local fitness centres are reviewed as well as suggested biking, running and skiing options. There is some good basic gambling advice (I have never read anything else that makes the seemingly impossible rules and betting systems of Craps so much easier to understand!) and hints as to which places are best suited to individual gambling preferences. My only criticism, and it is minor, is the lack of coverage afforded to attractions outside downtown & the strip. Sehlinger makes it clear that the locals of Las Vegas would rather the city be known for much more than the casino and gambling reuptation the town is built on, but he fails to go into detail the multitude of options around Vegas. Whilst this not may be his task (take a hint LVTB) and he does cover Red Rock, Valley of Fire, Lake Mead etc, there is very little reference to museums and other points of interest for those seeking more than the Strip & Downtown experience. Overall, an excellent book, and I know my future trips to Las Vegas will be far more enjoyable beacuse of it.	2005-10-04

The gradual loss of the Non-rebreathing valves, from the second edition followed by Goldman vaporizer, EMO, OMV etc has reduced the level of 'ease of understanding' for fresh residents.

I have to admit up front that I am not a regular cook. My husband and I eat out at least four nights a week. I am also an Indian Food junkie. We are blessed in the Milwaukee area to have many Indian restaurants that my husband and I visit regulary (averaging at least once a week - many of the restaurant owners greet us by name!)  <br />I got to see Alamelu give a cooking demonstration at the local \"Asian Moon Festival\" and bought her book at that time. It is a wonderful book to read with good photos that make your mouth water, but I was a bit intimidated by the \"new\" ingredients and put off trying the recipes for a while.  <br />A couple of months later, I had the opportunity to take a cooking class with Alamelu. Again, I am not a cook (see above!). She demonstrated things clearly and everything we made was absolutely wonderful! She used recipes from her book and it was simple and easy to understand. I brought the leftovers home to my husband who was very impressed. Since then I have used the cookbook to make several new dishes at home. I was so inspired that I have purchased an arsenal of the \"new\" ingredients and am no longer afraid to try a new recipe (or two) at a time - as well as using some of the favorites I had already tried. I'll admit that I probably won't give up my restaurant habit completely, but I am cooking healthier and making better choices at home when I use Alamelu's book.  <br />Remember that life is too short to eat bad food!	2005-10-04

I loved the core knowledge curriculum.  The reason I switched my children to a charter school is that they started out teaching CK.  I also switched them back to the public school when the principal got away from CK and made it just like a public school.   <br /> <br />I agree that a teacher should supplement what is in the CK books to give their students a better understanding of the material.  Teaching the information exactly how it is presented in the books would be very dry.   <br /> <br />However CK is a great outline of what should be taught.  It covers a tremendous amount of knowledge including the fight for civil rights, all religious ideology, multicultural literature and more.  If there is a problem with the books, it is that many children would not be motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered. For many it would be too much.  Also weak teachers would be overwhelmed trying to cover everything.    <br /> <br />Hence, anyone claiming that CK supports a racist philosophy has never read the books.  Also I want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist misspelled the word.  It is not spelled rasist.  I also find it disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher.  When attending school, maybe that teacher would have benefited from a core knowledge foundation. <br />	2005-10-04

There are many reviewers that say this is nothing but reverse racism, that her redefinition of the word racism is nothing but her skewed opinion is the argument of the \"person who wants to go along with the conveyor belt\".  The offical definition of racism (according to the OED) is only 200 years and was shaped by racial relations in America and now that those racial relations have changed since the 1950's it is absolutly appropriate to alter the definition to explain the discrimination people of color feel in their everyday lives. Although I do not completly agree with how far her idea of racism goes it is absolutly true that there are negative psychological affects to people of race.  Some claim she makes overly broad generalizations for the white race but I believe the only overly broad assumtion is simply that all people in America actually want a just society where sucess will actually be directly linked to meritocracy and not in this society where the color of your skin DOES set you at a disadvantage.

This book attempts to defend the interpretation of the creation narrative in Genesis as occurring in six 24 hour days a little more than 6000 years ago.  In spite of Sarfati's claim that this has always been the position of the Christian church, the idea was discarded by most educated Christians by the 1940's.  It was revived in 1961 in the book The Genesis Flood by Morris and Whitcomb, which was a valid critique of then current geophysical theories, which have all been discarded since plate tectonics made sense of geophysics. <br /> <br />However, Morris also took the position that all fossil bearing sedimentary geological layers were laid down at he time of the Genesis flood.  Henry Morris was a personal friend of mine, but I couldn't agree.  I had already seen rock formations that could not be explained in this way and have since seen many more. <br /> <br />Sarfati spends several chapters trying to prove that the days of Genesis have to  be 24 hour days.  He disregards Psalm 90 (attributed, probably correctly, to Moses) which warns us that God's days are not necessarily the same as our days, and may be much longer.  Since there were no humans until the sixth day, the six were God's days.  However, in this review my purpose is to carefully examine Sarfati's scientific claims, not his Biblical interpretations.  <br /> <br />In chapter 8 (pp. 260-263) he endorses John Baumgardner's catastrophic plate tectonics theory of the Flood.  This is based on computer simulation. As an engineer I use simulations regularly in my work.  If you give a computer unrealistic input it won't correct you, it will just give you equally unrealistic answers.  Let's give this model a reality check: <br /> <br />\"Baumgardner's model begins with a pre-Flood super-continent.  While uniformitarian models assume that the ocean crust had mostly hot rock and very little cold rock, Baumgardner started with cold rock.  This meant that it was denser than the mantle below.\" <br /> <br />(Sarfati doesn't tell us how cold the crust is assumed to be.  Much of the old West Pacific crust has lost its original heat. It loses as much heat to the ocean above as it receives from the hot mantle beneath.  This upward heat flow gives a typical temperature change in the crust of about 12 C per kilometer of depth.  The chemical composition of oceanic crust is similar to that of the upper mantle so it is denser than the mantle but not dramatically so.)    <br /> <br />\"At the start of the Flood year, this began to sink into the softer, less dense mantle below.  Without any warm crust to resist, it could sink much more quickly than today.\" <br /> <br />(Observed subduction rates for old, cold crust at the Tonga Trench are about 20 cm per year.  The resistance which limits this rate is not from warm crust but from viscous drag in the mantle.  If Baumgardner assumes that entire thickness of the crust was at ocean temperature this only doubles the density difference and resulting downward force.  Since viscous drag is proportional to velocity the downward velocity of the slab would only be about 40 cm. per year.) <br /> <br />\"The friction from this movement generates heat, especially around the edges.  The mantle minerals are known to soften markedly under heat, so the friction would reduce, making it less resistant to further sinking.  So the crust sinks faster, generating more heat, which further softens the mantle, which makes the crust sink still faster.  Eventually it would sink at several km/h, billions of times faster than is happening today.  This is called runaway subduction.\" <br /> <br />(At this point the model becomes unrealistic. In fairness to Baumgardner, dehydration of basalts and sea floor sediments in the descending slab releases water which substantially reduces the viscosity of the magma on its upper side.  At most this can double the rate of descent since the lower side is unaffected.  Most of the energy lost to viscous drag produces slow convection in themantle, not heating.  Even if the viscosity were reduced by a factor of 100 we would only have a sinking rate of meters per year.)  <br /> <br /> \"The sinking ocean floor would drag the rest of the ocean floor along, in conveyor belt fashion, and would displace mantle material, starting large scale movement throughout the entire mantle.  However, as the ocean floor sank and rapidly subducted adjacent to the pre-Flood super-continent's margins, elsewhere the earth's crust would be under such tensional stress that it would be torn apart (rifted), breaking up both the pre-Flood super continent and the ocean floor\"  <br /> <br />(The tensional and bending stress is greatest immediately adjacent to the subducting plate and decreases with distance due to viscous friction between the crust and the mantle.  Rock is relatively weak in tension so even at the lower observed subduction rates, descending slabs frequently break off from the crust.  They can be imaged seismically, as Sarfati notes on page 282.  This stress distribution limits rifting to the vicinity of subduction so the remainder of the model is invalid.)  <br /> <br />Note that I used no uniformitarian assumptions in this analysis, only the laws of physics. Baumgardner's model is the best young-earth explanation of the Flood, so Sarfati's position on this has no scientific support. <br /> <br />Let's examine the scientific arguments for a young earth which Sarfati presents in chapter 11: <br /> <br />1. Earth's magnetic field decay. Any simulation which neglects the energy input to the \"dynamo\" from convection due to radioactive heating in the core and lower mantle will inevitably run down.  Therefore the results Sarfati quotes are no surprise.  The sun has a strong magnetic field which reverses itself every (approximately) 11 1/2 years.  Its \"dynamo\" is based on convection of ionized (and therefore conducting) gas. The earth's \"dynamo\" based on convection of  fluid metal will be much slower to reverse itself, but we have no reason to believe that the underlying mechanism is significantly different.   Whether or not we have detailed computer models of this dynamo does not affect the observed facts.  Point not proved. <br /> <br />2. Helium in zircons.  Sarfati argues as if all of the helium was produced when the rocks were formed and has  been escaping ever since, but it is produced continually by radioactive decay.  Diffusion is very temperature dependent so a zircon originally formed at high temperature but then cooled might have lost some early helium but retained nearly all that is recent.  Unless we have sufficient geological information to determine past temperatures such measurements give no indication of age.  Lacking this data, point not proved. <br /> <br />3. Salt in the sea:  Sarfati ignores removal of salt by formation of huge salt deposits due to the drying up of seas, as happened to the Mediterranean approximately 5 million years ago.  He also considers sea floor sediments a source of salt, ignoring the large quantities that are buried when these sediments are subducted along with oceanic crust.  Incomplete data, point not proven. <br /> <br />4. Missing old Supernova Remnants.  Sarfati calls the third stage of expansion isothermal.  The only way a gas (possibly ionized) can expand isothermally is by taking energy from its surroundings.  Therefore it must be cooler than the average temperature of its surroundings.  Such gas only radiates energy and is detectable if close to a star.  This faint halo around the star is impossible to distinguish from ordinary interstellar gas clouds.  Therefore it is no surprise that none have been detected. <br /> <br />5. Comets and the Kuiper Belt:  Sarfati points out that all of the 651 Kuiper belt objects detected (as of his writing) are more than 100 Km in diameter.  Recently one has been detected that is 50% larger than Pluto and probably should be considered a tenth planet.  Comparison with the asteroid belt indicates that small objects are much more numerous than large ones, but we can't see them with present or planned telescopes. <br /> <br />6. Lunar Recession:  Most tidal energy loss is caused by tidal friction against the continents, not the sea floor.  The early earth apparently had far less continental area than at present, and Pangea is believed to have been located at the South Pole.  Thus energy loss and recession rate were lower than at present. <br /> <br />7. Dinosaur blood - Sarfati bases his comments on a 1997 (non-scientist) reporter's interview with researcher Mary Schweitzer.  Schweitzer (now a professor) reports studies on a new dinosaur fossil (MOR 1125) in Science, 25 March 2005 p. 1952.  Large dense bones in dry conditions may fossilize on the outside but remain as bone inside.  After demineralizing a small sample of this bone they found remnants of the fibrous (largely protein) tissue that gives bone its toughness, including capillary blood vessels about 2/1000 of an inch in diameter.  Deep embedding in the mineral part of the bone apparently protected these against hydrolysis (breakdown) by water.  Sarfati's argument is simply \"I don't think these could be that old\".  <br /> <br />8. Radiohalos: Sarfati seems to consider this the \"crown jewel\" of his proofs, but they should be called Radon Halos rather than Polonium Halos. Polonium isotopes producing these halos are all products of the radioactive breakdown of Radon 222.  Its alpha particle energy is so nearly equal to rhat of Polonium 210, so their halos overlap unless the radioactive source is much less than a millionth of  a meter in diameter.  Because of overlaps only 5 of the 8 Uranium 238 series halos in Sarfati's drawing on page 358 are seen in photomicrographs. Such halos are usually found in mica (a component of  granite) adjacent to Uranium inclusions, but have also been reported in other Uranium-rich minerals. <br /> <br />Unlike the other elements produced by the decay of Uranium 238, Radon 222, an inert gas, easily diffuses through microscopic cracks in the mica.  Its half life, 3.5 days, is sufficient for it to travel from Uranium 238 inclusions in the rock to the site of the halo.  This can happen over thousands (even millions) of years since Radon is continually produced long after the rocks are formed.  These halos are definitely not an indication of either recent or rapid formation of these rocks. <br /> <br />We have to conclude that Sarfati has no convincing scientific evidence that the earth is younger than indicated by radioactive dating of ancient rocks.  His claim that radioactivity was greatly accelerated during the Flood is unsupported by either Science or Scripture. <br />  <br />Herbert P Jacobson <br />BS (Electrical engineering), MS (Computer science)	2005-10-04

In TIME TO HUNT, Stephen Hunter further embellishes the legend of master sniper Bob Lee Swagger. Known as \"Bob the Nailer\" in professional circles, Swagger is cunning, resourceful, and a remarkable marksman, skills he developed in his youth and honed during several memorable tours of duty in Vietnam. Because of these talents, Swagger is often drawn into scenarios that erupt into nightmarish violence, as depicted in POINT OF IMPACT and BLACK LIGHT, the first two books to feature this character.<br /><br />Although the prologue and final third of the novel occur today, the backbone of the book is set in Washington, DC and Vietnam circa 1970. The story focuses on a marine named Donny Fenn, serving in Washington after completing a tour of duty in Vietnam. Fenn, forced to spy on a fellow marine with ties to the peace movement, fails to carry out the wishes of his superiors and is summarily cycled back to the 'Nam. There, he links up with Swagger, the deadliest sniper in the Corps. Their subsequent heroics (set forth in violent detail by Hunter in some of his most gripping writing to date), add to the myth surrounding Swagger. Bona fide heroes, they are days away from returning home when they are attacked by their nemesis, the Russian sniper Soloratov. Swagger is wounded, and Fenn is killed. Although Swagger has no way of knowing it at that time, this attack holds the key to the mystery of why Soloratov has returned to threaten Swagger's wife and daughter three decades later.<br /><br />Hunter, like Swagger, is in a league by himself -- compulsively readable, he plunges readers into a world where conspiracies are the norm and sudden death is commonplace. From its explosive prologue to its gripping finale, TIME TO HUNT is certain to be one of the best pure suspense novels you'll ever have the pleasure of reading.	2005-10-04

Graphic, stunning and very honest, his story is breathtaking for sure.  The way he recalls his past crimes and assaults are heartbreaking too. Most touching and powerful are the moments he has with his parents as he tells them, event by event how he has become the animal in front of them, teetering on the brink of certain death should he choose to drink or drug again.  He was a truly sick, horrible and profoundly addicted guy.   <br />Most disturbing is realizing that in the face of great hope, optimism and change, Frey demands to steadfastly rely on his own \"self,\" refusing to allow the light of ANY spirit into his heart. He remains through it all, cold hearted, mean, angry, defiant, resentful, proud and likely, smug.  Through it all it becomes apparent that there's little or no true, humble redemption, in fact, he more or less dries out and returns to the world only to prove that the others in recovery are week and spineless believers in the 12 step programs and a higher power guiding them to a better purpose on the planet. <br />The book is FULL of anger, rage and defiance.  Frey insists that  he is above the laws, codes and  rules of society, Hazelden and  (not) ironically story structure, verse and outcome. <br />Does that mean that because Frey is a jerk that it's not a good story and it's not worth reading? No, of course not.  Reader beware, there's not an \"Oprah\" sized silver lining or rainbow at the end. <br />Take a deep breath and read it.  Sigh in relief that places like Hazelden exist and accept anyone willing to clean up.  Be grateful that this kicking and screaming man/child/boy is loose on the streets without a drink or drug fueling him.  Thank God that you're not carrying his pain, rage and arrogance. <br />The old saw about \"you take a drunken horse thief and sober him up and you're still left with a horse thief\" is certainly the case here.	2005-10-03

Ms. Tyler takes each book in turn, gives a synopsis of the plot and places it in historical context and in the context of Austen's life. She then explains those details that might be abstract to those not familiar with Regency culture, such as entailed property, the importance of walking and the attitude toward marriage, making the reader comfortable with the novel. She includes illustrations, interviews, quizzes and delightful bits on the side such as \"10 Surefire Ways to be Vulgar\", a table of average income and \"Sense and Sensibility: A Checklist\". In addition, she finishes the book lists of movie versions, book spin-offs and sequels and shows Austen's role (her \"legacy\") in our century.<br /><br />An Austen fan from way back, I found this a truly delightful book. Ms. Tyler is humorous as well as informative and her enthusiasm for Austen is apparent. This is a must-have for Austen fans, no question about it; the resources provided in The Friendly Jane Austen further the enjoyment of reading Austen's novels. It is also an excellent book for those that have just started reading Austen. With this book by your side, you can't fail to see just how wonderful Jane Austen was, and still is.	2005-10-03

I was excited to read the book, since I loved The Secret Life of Bees, and this one started off with great promise.... <br /> <br />However, the thinly explained plot finally got to me. It was ridiculous for the protagonist to immediately fall in love (with a monk no less) that she had one conversation with. Her mother's inexplicable need to mutliate herself isnt addressed almost until the end, with the exception of one passage in a book which related to the incident. There are poorly developed characters which pop in and out (Hepzibah, Kat, Benne, Mike, etc) Even the main character's daughter floats on the edge.... <br /> <br />The book is at its best when it muses upon the nature of marriage and comfort and routine - interesting questions that any woman in a long term partnership must address. The worst part of the book is the attempt to cloak it in an overdramatic plot with poorly developed characters. <br /> <br />I recommend as a beach read, if at all.	2005-10-03

If you want to know Batman, then you should really be meeting him right here.<br /><br />I especially like the Batman: Year one story. It is an excellent beginning, lots of in-jokes and capturing moments, even on-the-edge of the seat suspense, almost 100 pages of intense artwork. It is about the beginning of Batman like you have never seen it before, but also and probably more importantly, includes the beginning of Commissioner Gordon, a Lieutenant Gordon here, with a pregnant wife, who comes to Gotham City and finds his whole department on the take. The millionaire Bruce Wayne, has been training to become a vigilante since his parents where murdered by a gang of thieves. It is a psychological condition of revenge. He is trying to find the right formula to scare his victims. When he does, he goes up against the same criminals and kingpins that Lieutenant Gordon finds himself up against, no Jokers or Penguins here, but regular underworld types making it all the more level-headed, and thus a more accepting Batman and story. Batman fails in first few attempts, but manages miraculously to survive and continue on, both Gordon and Batman building their careers as crime fighters in Gotham City throughout the pages, a surprise bonus Catwoman introduced in the final act which sees the new crime-fighting duo of Batman and Gordon finally meeting up, without any sign of Robin among the 96 pages, this is certainly an alternative Batman and probably the best one. Miller's look is a murky color bleeding hard edges and smears, resulting in a Batman graphic novel that takes your breath away. The action sequences are better than any movie I can think off to date, your eyes go wide open from frame to frame as this is the kind of animate Batman you have always wanted to see in action.

When she arrives in Upchurch, a Stepford-like Connecticut suburb she discovers a town full of perfectly aerobicized and coiffed stay-at-home-mommies, complete with matching diaper bags. She hasn't quite been accepted by them, but when the queen bee invites her to lunch, she's so excited, but unfortunately finds her hostess face down in her kitchen in a pool of blood, with a butcher knife in her back. Kate's boredom results in her taking a crack at solving the murder. After all, the keystone cops cannot seem to figure out a motive or any suspects. She discovers that she and Kitty had a friend in common, Evan McKenna, a NY investigator who also happens to be a former lover she hasn't seen since an embarrassing incident that caused her to from New York and into the arms of her husband Ben. Ben wants Kate to leave the sleuthing to the authorities, while Kate just wants something to do three days a week while the kids are at school. With the help of Evan and her best bud Janie (who has the best lines!), Kate discovers that all is not well in tight-knit Upchurch, and there are plenty of secrets that people want to keep buried.<br /><br />\"Goodnight Nobody\" is a dramatic change from Weiner's regular writing style. But her excellent storytelling and funny narrative kept me hooked. She is at her best when she writes about relationships, but I felt that the two men in her life were not completely drawn out. There were far too many things left unresolved too and since Weiner does not write sequels, the reader is left to wonder.	2005-10-03
US	51624230	R2SKFZWXI9YM6	0425190838	13401207	Track of the Cat (An Anna Pigeon Novel)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Undecided	I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I didn't love it. The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing, but the plot was, at times, predictable. The setting was well-drawn, but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. The clincher, though, is that I'm not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character. I believe that this is her first story, so I don't want to make a snap judgement, but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple. That would be expecting a lot, I know, but frankly she isn't even as engaging as, say, Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael, and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.<br /><br />As I said, the jury is still out for me here. I liked TRACK OF THE CAT, but I wasn't wild about it. It's a solid first try, and I'll certainly read another Anna Pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series. I expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable. I recommend it, but my recommendation is a mild one.	2005-10-03

Due to this books poor reviews I thought it would be a good place to start.   <br /> <br />As Jack Ryan is not the center of my literary universe, the fact that he is not the cental figure here does not bother me.  As I began to read I expected the worst but I found myself enjoying this book more than I thought I would.  The end was a bit of a disappointment, seemed a bit rushed and didn't tie up some of the loose ends like I would of liked.  Where does the Rabbit and his family actually end up in the US anyway? <br /> <br />I did enjoy the cat and mouse game with the Foley's in Moscow and really enjoyed the days in Budapest leading up to the actual defection.  Plodding, a but slow but it still held my interest. <br /> <br />I'll read more of Clancy and this is probably not his best work but it's not the worst book I've read either.	2005-10-03
US	16313992	R12B7RCRUTHNFU	0385324162	390234841	A Breath of Snow and Ashes (Outlander)	Books	5	22	26	N	N	Leaves you satisfied, but eager for more!	Yay, yay, yay!!  ABOSAA was simply wonderful!  I think it may possibly be my favorite of the series, other than Outlander.  DG resolves a great many issues and mysteries, but at the same time she leaves us all on tenterhooks, eager for the next book.  I don't think of the book has having a real plot, per se.  It mostly focuses on the daily life of the Frasers, similarly to FC, although certainly there's more going on.  The American Revolution is certainly ramping up and has a presence in the book, but since the Frasers are in NC and most of the action of the war at this point is taking place in New England -- and it takes quite a while for information and news to travel throughout the Colonies -- the war seems more like distant background.  We know it's coming, but it's not the main thrust of the story, although Diana Gabaldon does explain quite a bit about the Committees of Safety and Committees of Correspondence, which played a role during the years before the meat of the Revolutin.  I did get the sense that the next book will be much more focused on various aspects of the war, and perhaps will even be set farther north than Fraser's Ridge.       I've never considered Bree to be particularly whiny or Roger to be a wimp, as has often been complained by some readers, but each certainly comes into their own in this story.  They seem more well-rounded somehow...much more comfortable with one another and with their places at the Ridge, although perhaps still not entirely reconciled to their fish-out-of-water existence in the 18th century.  They're still not as moving a couple as Jamie and Claire -- but who is???  (Jamie and Claire are magnificent, as always.)  For those who are curious...yes, the mystery surrounding Jem's paternity is settled once and for all.    Ian is back in this story and has a strong presence, which made me happy.  We learn what happened to him and Emily, and why he's back at the Ridge.  Will he stay, though?  I get the feeling DG has plans for him.    There are myriad other events surrounding the main and secondary characters that will have you cringing and laughing.  The ending is a cliffhanger and I have to say it took me by surprise.  Some people have complained that it's rather abrupt, but I kind of liked that.  The \"abruptness\" of the ending merely left me incredibly eager for future books.  I can't wait to see what DG does with Book 7!!      For those fans who had a hard time with The Fiery Cross, this book has a much faster, smoother pace.  The first half of TFC was somewhat difficult to slog through -- speeding up considerably in the second half -- but this book takes off from page one and the slower moments are few and far between.  I have to say I feel another total series re-read coming on, if only so that I can hold onto the characters a little longer.   DG has said that she anticipates that there will be AT LEAST two books to come in the series, but I get the feeling there will be at least three unless she pulls a Voyager and skims over a few years.  (ABOSAA ends at the end of 1776.)    I can also recommend the unabridged audio version, read by Davina Porter, which I'm listening to now after reading the book.  I've never listened to any of the series on audio and it's simply amazing.  Gabaldon's work takes on a whole new dimension when you're listening to it.  I find myself admiring her writing and wordsmithing a great deal, and I've snorted in laughter far many more times while listening than I did while reading the book.  Gabaldon's droll, wry humor underscores every word.     Totally satisfying!	2005-10-03

Later, life and a new marriage brought her back to the ancient land, and the passage of time and age conspire to reinvigorate the ancient land. The book is a travelogue of sorts, covering everything from being adopted by a local Sikh family to visiting places like Chandigarh, Varanasi and meeting people like Mata Amritanandamayi, the Indian hugging enthusiast.	2005-10-03
US	25785093	R5XVE4HPWDCID	0793805708	610810770	The Encyclopedia of Exotic Tropical Fishes for Freshwater Aquariums	Books	5	50	52	N	N	And old hand at this...	I've been keeping freshwater fish (and just about everything else that ever tooled about the freshwater environment at one time or another) for a long, LONG time, and I've found this text to be as authoritative and reader-friendly as books can get.  Simply stated, the novice can learn all he or she needs to about a species or genera of fish in order to successfully keep that species in captivity, while the advanced hobbyist has at his or her fingers an unparalleled resource text in this book.  As an expert whose knowledge is certainly limited, I've found this book to be a sort of catch-all text that answers most any question I might have about the freshwater species of fishes.  More so even than that, I consider this book a reference text in that when I go to the local fish shop and I see something I've never seen before, I can come home, reference my Encyclopedia of Freshwater Fishes, and come away with a solid understanding of the species that I just encountered for the first time; I don't have to rely on the \"guess and pray\" information given me by the pet shop's clerk, I can simply rely on this book to fill in the gaps and bridge the information-gulfs that stand between me and my chosen species of captive fish. <br /> <br />While the above information is simply my amateur opinion on the information the text provides, the following is my professional take on the book as published work.  My name is Phil Purser, and many of you may have read my books on Moray Eels, Green Treefrogs, or Garter & Ribbon Snakes.  I've been writing on fish & reptiles/amphibians for over a half-decade, and I know what is good and what sucks when it comes to the pet trade.  I've read myriad books by \"authors\" who couldn't find their noses in the dark, and I've read authoritative books by the leading minds of the field, and I can honestly say that, after reading this book from the front cover to the back, this text is one book that will stay one my personal shelves for years and years to come.  The information in it is up-to-date, accurate, and timeless (of course nomenclature can change, but the care of each species is pretty well fixed).  When you've got all the information you'll ever need in one book, why would you ever reach for another? <br /> <br />The authors of this book are some of the best in the field...better even than myself.  Despite my decades of experience studying and writing about fishes, I still defer my questions and inquiries to men such as Glen Axelrod and Brian Scott.  Any hobbyist who keeps his or her fingers on the pulse of the freshwater aquarium hobby will attest to the expertise of these scholars; they know their stuff!   <br /> <br />I guess what I'm saying is that if an old expert like me can enjoy and reference a book so much as I have this text, then ANYONE who is even remotely interested in the keeping and understanding of freshwater fishes can certianly learn from and relish a book like this one.  I honestly believe that a book to rival this one in scope and depth of knowledge will be written for a long, long time to come.	2005-10-03

She was supposed to be an astrophysicist and yet she hardly does anything in the entire book. It's all just Zaphod and Arthur and Ford with personality. It may have been his intention to percieve Zaphod as larger than life... but did he have to make Trillian practially dead in order for that to happen? Is she just the token female? It seems that way when I read it. I loved the books though, I just noticed Trillian was missing from the excitement. She was my favorite in the movie.	2005-10-03

If he had reinforced some of his theories by hashing them out more with real Italians or spending more time in Itay I don't think it would have changed the book much. Italians are indeed jaded with their systems, and it is not so much laziness as a keen and entirely justified sense of futility that keeps them from open revolt. <br /> <br />Soccer is written about extensively because it is the national obsession and mirrors Italian life in many ways, as the author describes. If you don't like soccer you start out at a considerable disadvantage here.  <br /> <br />I think that with more time and care this could have become two books: one on general culture and life, and the other focusing more on politics. I can kind of see why he's attempting to weave them together, but I can't say that I have met many Italians who are in any way interested in politics; the one or two who have been look at it completely from an opportunistic point of view. Americans have a hard time understanding how much the \"party\" controls everyday life here.. party contacts get you a job, a building permit, your company magically wins a bid, your red tape goes away, and so on...  This is what life is like here; it is not Jones' \"claim.\" <br /> <br />The only strong principled stance I have ever heard expressed by politicians is that against the death penalty; the rest is just a perpetual motion conspiracy machine that keeps them rotating in their 'poltrone' -their comfortable positions- in a never-ending game of musical chairs. As another reviewer pointed out, figuring out Italian politics is like nailing Jell-O to the wall, or herding cats. The targets are always moving,the story never ends, the facts never come to light. (I tell people to imagine if every news story in the U.S. were to play out like the Kennedy assassination, only with no Zapruder film and no Warren Commission). However, my Italian husband highly recommends Indro Montanelli's \"L'Italia del Novecento\" (20th-Century Italy), so keep an eye out for that if it ever gets translated, for a thorough, level-headed overview by one of that nation's top journalists, that carries through the 2000 elections.  <br /> <br />\"The Dark Heart of Italy\" is a good book if you want to dip your toe into the murky waters.. If you've got scuba gear check out \"In God's Name\" by David (?) Yallop..	2005-10-03

I picked up WILD ROSES without even reading the summary, and I don't regret it at all. <br /> <br />WILD ROSES is about Cassie Morgan, a teenage girl that most readers will be able to relate to: her parents are divorced, she doesn't really like her mom's choice in men (at least, she doesn't like her step-father, world famous violin player, Dino), and she's afraid to fall in love. <br />That is, until Ian Waters comes along. <br />Cassie and Ian have a connection from the second they meet, and her unease with the situation is what makes the book so wonderful - she wants to be closer to him, but at the same time, she's not sure if that's what is best for her. <br /> <br />WILD ROSES is an incredibly realistic story about coping with divorce and falling in love for the first time. However, the book isn't all about being upset over divorce and falling for a boy - the most interesting (and heartbreaking) part is the storyline about Cassie's step-father, Dino, who is a time bomb waiting to go off.  <br /> <br />Deb Caletti is amazing, and if you like Sarah Dessen books, or if you've read Caletti's other books (Honey, Baby, Sweetheart, and The Queen of Everything), you'll love this one too.	2005-10-02

Was it the moral tenants she was exposed to in her Catholic background?  A few good teachers?  Caring and involved school counselors?  Her exposure to \"normal\" life via The Fresh Air Fund? Or was she just born with \"the right stuff\"?  Her writing displays a chilling lack of introspection and gratitude for those who may have helped her.  But maybe that is all part of being a \"welfare brat.\" <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I think this book should be required reading in the schools.  Certainly it is a strong argument for federally funded childcare facilities that might help give children of even the most dysfunctional families a glimpse of the possibilities for a better life.	2005-10-02

Last year, my junior year of high school, I was, for various reasons, suffering from a profound lack of intellectual self-esteem.  I have always been a very bright student, but I got to the point of wondering if, perhaps, my parents and all the adults who knew me had made some sort of grave mistake.  Then my philosophy teacher, as a sort of respite from the back-breaking work we had been doing, had us read Atlas Shrugged during the last two weeks of class (and not from a personal bias of his...he himself is a Marxist).  I literally couldn't put it down; my parents told me off a few times for trying to sneak in little snippets of reading during mealtimes.  When I finished, I had to, in a sense, \"step back\" in order to appreciate what I had read.  The thing that hit me most was something that I think many people fail to grasp: Rand's great industrialists, artists, philosophers, etc. are not Nietzchean supermen.  They are simply people who have worked to hone their abilities and be the best at what they do.  Anyone capable of thinking is capable of succeeding. <br /> <br />Seeing this presented to me in such a blunt, straightforward, rational manner was like a much-needed slap in the face.  I realized that I had been a fool to think that I was incapable of success.  I also gained new respect for humanity as a whole.  Many people sadly spurn and reject their fellows when they read Ayn Rand, because they see others as somehow weak or evil.  Let's set one thing straight: the only thing intrisic to human beings is being human.  How can one feel disdain toward another human being while at the same time knowing the vast things that that person, as a human being, is capable of?  Selfishness in the Objectivist sense is not the greedy, all-consuming obsession with oneself at the expense of everything and everyone else.  Rather, it is working always toward what is best for oneself, realizing that one has the right to do so, and realizing that others have the right to do the same. <br /> <br />This is not a novel in the conventional sense, nor is it meant to be.  It is a treatise on a philosophical point of view and on its applications and repercussions.  The reason for the length of the book is its thoroughness; Rand covers the application of Objectivism in literally every area of life, from business to friendship to sex.  Yes, there are definitely flaws in the book.  John Galt's famous 50-page speech could definitely have been cut in half, and I will confess to skimming after the first 15 pages or so.  However, I don't think that this detracts significantly from the greatness of the book, and so I can let it slide. <br /> <br />I do feel compelled to say that, while this book did wonders for me, that was a personal thing.  It will not have the same effect on you, because you are a different person in different circumstances.  My problem was purely psychological; I was not depressed in the medical sense, and so a change in my state of mind was what I needed and what this book was able to supply.  Besides not being a panacea, this is not a book to take as dogma.  To unquestioningly accept all the principles and premises of Atlas Shrugged violates the spirit of the book; remember, the highest action a person can perform is to THINK.  Question the book, argue about it, dissect its arguments and see what makes them tick.  If, after all that, you still find yourself agreeing with Rand, then you can consider yourself an Objectivist.	2005-10-02

Better yet, it addresses in plain words how to tame (or kill) the resource-hogging 'Organizer', that brings even the fastest notebook to its knees. The writing is lucidly spare, comfortably conversational, delivers the complete package as promised - without attempting forced 'humor' - and it explains difficult concepts such as the histogram as well as I have seen. In plain words, it tells you not only the what-it-is and the how-to of the numerous tools and functions, but also the why's. <br /> <br />So why not award the five stars the text and illustrations fully deserve? It's for omission of a CD with high-quality work-along images that help you build the skills towards working on your own photo's. How many beginners would have access to an eight-layered image as shown in Fig 6-1? Just opening that image from an enclosed CD would have gone worlds towards a faster and better comprehension of the text - good as it may be. Likewise for the terrific Camera RAW Converter plugin - few beginners would have a RAW image handy, and so lose out on one of the best enhancements in PSE3. Even learning how to use the Organizer would have been helped by having a few dozen simple images on a CD. <br /> <br />True, the Introduction (p. xxiii) promises downloadable images to support the tutorials but, when you get there eventually, you'll find just three pitiful images to support another author's tutorial. In fact, the Errata section strikes out any reference to downloadable images at all. Even Scott Kelby's images - disfigured as they are - at least help you learn the basics by hands-on application of text. Lacking a CD that replicates the illustrations simply eliminates this book from top consideration for beginners, and makes it more suitable as a reference source.	2005-10-02

Reading this study of the plight of Soviet women after several years of Mr. Gorbachev's reformism is cause for wonder as to whether the liberation of women from second-class citizenship will be realized sooner in Kuwait than in the Soviet Union. Anyone who has read the recent book, \"Soviet Women,\" by Francine du Plessix Gray, knows that their plight is rooted deep in Russian culture. <br /> <br />Miss Atwood, a British-trained Sovietologist, concludes that the present socioeconomic climate will drive women back from their supposed emancipation under Bolshevism to the more traditional female role of homemaker. It is not easy to predict the capacity of a social system to change, but if there is one area of Soviet social development where little progress will occur, it is likely to be in the area of women's rights.	2005-10-02

I think this book would be helpful for many people who are single or in a smaller family as is more the norm these days.  If you don't really want a cake sitting around for days, or want fresh bread at a meal, this book is great way to go.   <br /> <br />The recipes are designed for as much convenience as possible.  Baking does necessarily take time, but the author utilizes mixes and other short cuts.  My only complaint is about the recommendation of aluminum cans as baking pans.  The cakes' edges baked and set before the centers did, because of the cheap metal.  (It can be hard to find heavier quality metal cans even in premium brand canned goods.  Freight is expensive!)  I found them awkward to unmold and made for a visually unappealing result that required trimming.  I did find small baking pans after a little searching around town, however, and this solved the problem.  <br /> <br />This book would also have been improved by either providing nutritional information or lower fat substitutions for those practicing portion control for dietary reasons.  I think this was overlooked by the author and/or publisher as a potential marketing value for such a cookbook.	2005-10-02

It covers the rock music TV scene from Dick Clark's \"American Bandstand\" show through the troubled \"American Idol.\" Its author is Jake Austen, producer of the popular Chic-A-Go-Go show on Chicagoland Public Access cable channnels, so he is in a position to know about this subject. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, TV-a-Go-Go : Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol  falls well short of the mark. It is one of those \"quickie\" books that takes only a superficial look at its subject. Many of its assertions are  questionable. For instance, Austen claims that punk rock only became popular after the band Fear was on \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1981. Actually, punk rock was popular before 1981 and it was the result of that popularity that Fear made it on the show. <br /> <br />Austen claims that many classic cartoons such as \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" and \"The Banana Splits\" were examples of rock TV. Well, this writer grew up watching those shows and the only way that you can classify those shows as rock music oriented is if your definition of rock music is so broad as to include everything from the William Tell Overture aka the \"Lone Ranger\" music to Garth Brooks. In other words, its a ridiculous assertion. <br /> <br />There are other problems with this book. There is practically nothing about the sleazy likes of Alan Freed and the payola scandals that shook the rock music scene during the late 1950's and the early 1960's. There is also nothing about the spread of perversion and immorality into rock music, which began as clean music. There is little about the local and regional rock TV shows, which is strange since the author is the producer of one such show. <br /> <br />The basic problem with TV-a-Go-Go : Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol , is that for all its claims of being the definitive book on its subject, there really is little new about its subject. Almost everything in it was originally published in other, better books. You would be much better off hunting down those books in your local public library rather than plunking down your hard earned money for this book. <br /> <br />TV-a-Go-Go : Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol is a book about an interesting subject that is in itself less than interesting.	2005-10-01

This temperament may frustrate some of you that like heroines with more of a back-bone, but remember as in life, all friends have different personalities so if Tabby doesn't do it for you, hang in there and wait for funky hilarious Hilary--my favorite of the friends!  Pippa has a great tale, too...but Tabby has a wonderful story here too, and she is a devoted friend to her pals, as we find out in the other  books in this series.<br /><br />WILL SOMEONE PLEASE email me @ Cyndi@DreamEmporium.com and let me know where to find the title for the remaining book in this series, the story of Jenny?  I can't find info anywhere; maybe it isn't written yet as of this writing.  I'm waiting patiently, Lynne Graham...tap-tap-tap-tap...<br /><br />Have I mentioned I have almost all of Lynne Graham's books?  GREAT AUTHOR.  Don't miss reading her books if you haven't discovered her yet.	2005-10-01

The first was extreme resistance, because I was reading about things that threatened the very foundations of my perceived existence here. The second was tears of relief - finally, the questions I'd been asking myself my whole life were being answered fully and uncompromisingly.

Reading this book has been one of the most beautiful gifts that a human being  <br />can receive.  I was delighted reading it from the beginning to the end. The whole time I read it, I was overcome with thoughts of Padre Pio throughout my day. The book was beautifully written. It made me cry and it made me laugh. Padre Pio is the most loving man, priest, a true holy and faithful follower of Jesus Christ. What a life Padre Pio lead. It is amazing the relationship he had with Jesus and Mary, even with his Angels. Reading this book has been a healing, a transformation, and kind of a retreat for me, allowing me to see life with true faith, hope and love.  Somehow it humbles you and brings you a feeling of peace; I even felt Padre Pio's presence while I read this book.  Renzo Allegri deserves the Nobel prize for having taking the time to accomplished all the documents and information to write this wonderful book.

The information about the mandorla was particularly helpful, giving a visual and archetypical model for holding the energy of the apparently opposite forces in a space of new possibility.  <br /> <br />Johnson writes that if I can be with the opposites, at the point of their intersection and stay with my conflicting thoughts and impulses long enough, the two will teach each other something and produce an insight that serves both... produce something utterly new instead of win, lose or compromise.   <br /> <br />The key appears to be that every real solution has to grow from the unique situation I face. Formulas, how-to's, devices and processes can never be enough in such moments. Referring to my own past for an experiential reference or to another's experience or advice can't do it, either, because it prevents or sidetracks the point of unlimited potential that wants to appear in and emerge out of each unique encounter. <br /> <br />I liked what Maria had to say in her post: \"Meet your shadow\", dated November 22, 2003. She said she gave it only 4 stars because he doesn't tell how to DO that is described as possible in the book... I felt a little of that, too. And I have since appreciated the blessing of not being told how until I've done a bit of my own struggle with my own opposites in many life situations.  <br /> <br />A book I found to be a perfect companion to this one is \"I of the Storm - Embracing Conflict, Creating Peace\", by Gary Simmons. I highly recommend it in addition to this book. It addresses some of the questions I felt about the nature of conflict after finishing Owning Your Own Shadow, in a way that shed light into my life. I am very appreciative of both books.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-01

Well Maybe	Everybody knows trolls hide under the bridge and when you cross, they jump out and scare you to death right?<br /><br /> Right.  Except, well, there are trolls, and then there's ORSO THE TROLL WHO COULDN'T SCARE.  He's the main character in a picture book with story by Brad Thiessen and illustrations by Jeremy Balzer.  The team has created  a charming tale and setting, for people aged 3 t0 8, but the story's sure to delight anybody.<br /><br /> Orso Troll lives with his father under a bridge. Mr. Troll takes great delight in frightening people out of their wits, but Orso would rather spend the day climbing trees, walking in the meadow, playing with the animals he meets in the forest, and talking to clouds.<br /><br /> The day Orso turns eight,  he sits in front of his birthday cake wishing he could share it with some troll friends.  But though gentle with him, his father explains that trolls don't have friends.  They're only good for one thing, scaring people.  \"You have me,\" Dad points out, when Orso feels alone.<br /><br /> For the reassurance, Orso gives his father a big troll hug.  That tickles, and his dad begs him to cut it out.  Trolls don't give hugs, though Mr. Troll finds himself enjoying the one he's gotten.<br /><br /> The next day, Dad takes Orso under the bridge, to learn to scare the world.  But poor Orso can't even try.  Running home, he cowers on his bed.  His dad accepts that Orso is going to be a nontraditional troll.  Together, they try to think of other things trolls might do, besides frighten everyone.  Nothing comes to mind.<br /><br /> Next morning, two human children, Lizzy and Jacob, meet Orso in the woods.  Orso tries halfheartedly to frightens them.  He almost succeeds with Jacob, but Lizzy laughs.<br /><br /> What happens next brings  a startled response from Mr. Troll, a big change in both Orso and Mr. Troll's lives, and something very special on Orso's next birthday, when he turns 9.<br /><br /> ORSO THE TROLL WHO COULDN'T SCARE empowers children.<br /><br />Brad Thiessen suggests even the smallest youngsater make a big difference in a loved one's life, even if that person is a grown up.<br /><br /> The author also breaks stereotypes found in traditional stories about creatures such as trolls.  He depicts girls as strong, and guys as flexible and willing to examine the lives they are leading.<br /><br /> The troll characters have the gambit of moods.  They grow and change, as good characters should in a story.<br /><br /> Belief in trolls dates back thousands of years,  especially in Scandinavia, but Mr. Thiessen tells Orso's story in 21st Century language.  Illustrator Jeremy Balzer sets the tale in a world neither ancient nor modern.  His pictures  are spooky in a fun way.  They catch Orso's feelings from the joy he gets while swinging on a tree branch, to the terror he experiences when his father roars at the driver of a horse and wagon.<br /><br /> The effect gives ORSO THE TROLL WHO COULDN'T SCARE a timeless sense, and a sense of the harmless fun found in a scary, but make believe, Halloween costume.  It delivers the gentle message that being truly mean is not necessary--even for a troll.  There is another way to get through life.

I always found his playing to be one of the more interesting elements in the Dead's music.  He approaches music in a conceptual way as well as in an intuitive way, as he articulates here.  And now it turns out he can write compellingly too.  I had a hard time putting the book down.    The writing is discursive and goes into much of the story of that era, in a way that made me both laugh and weep at times.  Much of it will be familiar as far as the facts go, but Lesh's perspective adds a lot of depth in the telling. I was a teenage Dead fan, though it's been a long time since I listened to their music much. (I wish he had at least touched on some of their early events in El Camino Park in Palo Alto, which remain memorable).  Growing up in their neck of the woods, it is hard to overstate how much influence they had over the mindset of the generation just behind them.      Some readers have found the parts on sound systems and recording techniques to be boring or beside the point.  Though this is not my area, I found these discussions to be quite interesting.  This book is by someone who is unapologetically serious about music as well as the other cultural aspects that went with this particular music.  It may not be for everyone but for some even the nerdy parts will be fascinating, and as a whole it is very evocative.    Probably the most interesting thing to me about the autobiographical aspect of this book is the contrast between Lesh's keen intelligence and seriousness about his music and his occasionally out of control meandering ways, but then, that's probably par for the course.    My favorite factoid: who knew Jerry Garcia was a model train aficionado?	2005-10-01

The orphan \"home\" system had its merits and may be beneficial in a combined approach, but McKenzie pushes for it so hard that the end of the book reads more like a political text (which it partially is- the writer is obviously conservative and weaves his political opinions in throughout the memoir) instead of a personal story.	2005-10-01

I much prefer a good thriller. However, Tapply and Brady Coyne are the exception to my rule.<br /><br />Nervous Water is another entry into the Coyne series.  I am never sure if I just really like Tapply's writing or if I just really like the character her created.  Regardless, this book is another wonderful Brady Coyne story.<br /><br />What makes these books so great is that Tapply has given his characters \"real life\" traits.  They fight, make mistakes and work their way through the storylines at such a delightful and real pace that you can almost feel that they are real.<br /><br />Nervous Water explores deep-rooted family issues intermingled with legal and personal issues.  At the same time, being entertaining and a page turner.<br /><br />I am not sure about the relationship between our main character and his \"love\".  I always kind of feel that this does not work for Coyne and he should be single for a while.<br /><br />Also, I do find it difficult to plod through all the fishing references made (and there are alot in this one). I know that Tapply is a fishing enthusiast, but I would love for him to figure out that there is a really good chance that most of his fans ARE NOT and that is why I give this book 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise.

The tax base would be a gross receipt manufacturer or use (indirect) tax and a gross receipt income (direct) tax.  The indirect tax would be used to fund the necessary government services that protect international commerce and promote interstate travel (U.S Highways and Interstate Expressways).  This tax, for the most part, is already in place, defined as the excise taxes in Subtitle D of the Internal Revenue Code.  The gross receipts income tax would be in place to maintain controls upon expenditures and which for the most part is already in place as the income, estate and gift, and employment tax (Subtitles A, B and C of the Internal Revenue Code).  The maximum tax percentage would be 10%. To obtain maximum efficiency in collecting the taxes, we need to collect from the fewest sources as possible (which means a big \"NO\" to a national sales tax).     The authors have not presented any proof for their claims. Note the lack of actual dollar figures wherever they talk about funding.	2005-09-30

This is what is commonly known as 'inner work'.  <br /> <br />On the other hand, the author goes into explanations of some basic yogic principles around the rising of the Kundalini energies along the Ida and Pingala channels along the Sushumna.  To the crown chakra of enlightenment. <br /> <br />So the book is a strange, and somewhat novel, blend of Eastern and western esoteric techniques towards enlightenment.  However it's done in such a way that it ofetn comes off being very dense, and a little confusing. <br /> <br />However, it is an interesting read and is certainly unique in that it breaks the mold of the Western Mystery Tradition not concerning itself with the wisdom from the East.  From this stand point alone the book is a worthy addition to your collection. <br /> <br />As to whether it's an advanced guide to alchemy? Probably not, but still worth a read. <br />	2005-09-30

Give me an investing fool with a good editor any day.  Who cares if you can quote Nabokov and Trollope?  Am I supposed to be impressed because you used the word tintinnabulation not once, but twice (!) in this book?  The show-off intellectual tone of this book detracted from the story, which would have been much better had it focused solely on the insanity of the tech craze and the underhanded and/or insanely optimistic dealings which went on.<br /><br />As a narrator, Denby never revealed the magnitude of the money he put into the market, and I think that would have added a lot to the book.  Shouldn't the American Sucker tell all when he's revealing all his mistakes and missteps?  Also, his quarterly reports did little to add to the understanding of his financial portfolio.<br /><br />Denby did do a good job illustrating how the market worked, without resorting to a textbook style.  He explained how much capital is required to push a drug like Erbitux through FDA trial, and how production has to be ramped up even before approval in order to meet demand.  There are some good lessons about the stock market wheelings and dealings of the year 2000, if you can get past Denby's never-ending pretension.	2005-09-30

US	36632221	RK53URYFEADFZ	0964350408	816500301	Who Is Fourier?: A Mathematical Adventure	Books	5	35	36	N	N	Unique and Quite Amazing	This is a great book, but probably different from anything you might expect. On flipping through the pages it looks like one of those comic book guides, but don't let that decieve you; there is a lot of serious material in this book. \"Who is Fourier\" is certainly not equivalent to a college level textbook on Fourier Analysis, but neither is it simply a descriptive overview.  The book is filled with equations, and some of them are quite complex.  What is unique in this book is that the equations are explained from the ground up, starting from an extremely basic level, yet building to a fair level of complexity. If you have taken any math beyond high school algebra, this can sometimes be annoying because the book really assumes essentially no knowledge of anything beyond basic math.  On the other hand, if you have not had much math, this is really good because it makes the text accessible to virtually everyone, and if you have taken some more advanced classes in math, you may still find some interesting surprises in the basics.  I know I did.    In spite of the very basic building blocks that this book begins with, the book does take you through some pretty serious stuff.  The Fourier series itself is covered in roughly the first third of the book.  From there, the basics of differentiation, integration, vectors, complex numbers, Maclaurin series, and the Euler formula are described, leading one steadily from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform.      The only thing I can see that might turn some people off is the somewhat comic book style in which the book is written. To understand the reason behind the style, one must understand who wrote the book and why. The book really was not originally written for the general public, but for members of a club whose members learn up to 11 differnet languages simultaneously.  The club is related to the Transnational College of LEX which does research into the way we learn languages.  The study of waveforms was a natural extension of their interest in languages, and this led, of course, to Fourier analysis.  The book essentially chronicles the students' own learning of Fourier analysis, and it was written as a means of sharing what they learned with other students and members of their club, so it was written in a very casual style, including little stick figure illustrations of characters representing the students and various historical figures.  It even has simulated dialogue between the students and fictional characters.  I debated about giving the book four stars instead of five because I personally do not care for this style very much, but in the end, I'm not sure the book would be quite as effective if it were written in a more formal style, so I left it at five stars.  The book is truly unique and quite amazing.    As a side note, I just glanced at the preview pages on Amazon.  These really don't do justice to the book.  Although they give a good idea of the general layout of the book, and the sort of comic book style in which it is written, they don't show any of the meat in the book.  There is much more to the book than suggested by the preview pages.	2005-09-30

Chocolate Friday has so many strong messages.  You have a pure self discovery story, an opposites attract romantic courtship, passionate heat erruptions (I'm still cooling down!), and much more.  Edwina Martin-Arnold does a great job at capturing the edgy and humorous side of urban lifestyle while delivering a candid look at \"real love\" development between the books lead characters.  \"I felt like I was actually in the minds of Olivia and Flava because the book is written in a clever 1st person style.\"  You almost feel like you are in to deep and peering into the personal lives of the actual people.

She gave it back to me explaining that she couldn't finish it.  The book was just too large.  She was just too busy to process it all.    This is ironic as Fennel's methods easily blend into ordinary daily  person <-> dog interactions and are very simple.    The problem is that the book is 4 times larger than it needs to be.  Her methods could have been explained in about 50 - 100 pages with plenty of room left over for some illustrative anecdotal accounts.      A good editor could have saved this book.    The same goes for her video, which I found terribly disjointed.  If I had not read the book I would not have understood what she was trying to communicate.    Fennel's methods are truly innovative, cruelty free, cheap, and practical.  I hope she decides to hire an editor for her books and her videos to make her ideas easily accessible.

BRAVA is Kensington's current Romantica/Erotica line.  While this book is great reading - I really enjoyed it - fans of pure Brava style might find this a little light in the erotica \"heat\".  The writers are solid.  I especially like Jen Nicholas' story.  It has GREAT premise for a series, and I hope to see it done down the road.  However, by Brava's hot hot hot standards, the story is slower developing.  About 80-page novella and the Hero and Heroine don't meet until chapter four.  I am not saying this is a fault, just a \"meter\" for those trying to gauge the level of their romances.  If you go in wanting Red Sage level, you might be disappointed.  For those of use just looking for a great sexy Romance Anthology then this is dead on target.<br /><br />Jen Nicholas shows bright promise as a Romance writer.  THE CUPID CURSE is engaging, breezy.  She is very strong with quirky characters and an original premise that lends itself more to a sexy romance series than erotica.  I hope she follows through on this premise and does some CUPID tales.  We learn there is not one Cupid, but thousands.  There is Cupid Central where they handle details of romances.  Like a Romance Publisher who receives a flood manuscripts from hopefuls, Cupid Central is flooded with letters that are along the lines of `Dear Santa' letters, only these are `Dear Cupid, please find me the perfect man (or woman...lol).  When Valentine Lewis sends in her request, they naturally sit up and take notice.  Gideon is a cupid in training (along the lines of a nun - how they have novices and you get an idea of Gideon's standing in Cupid Central).  This is THE case to put him over at CC and get him promoted to full Cupid.  Only when he shoots his arrow meant for Valentine's chosen, he ends up accidentally shoots himself in the bum!!!  Love has to ensure.  The story is bright, witty, engaging, but it's until chapter for until the Heroine and Hero meet.  Fine by me, but other erotica readers might get antsy.  As I said, the premise is perfect for a series of stand alone titles and I hope to hear more from this talented writer.<br /><br />MESMERIZED is another funny tale.  Amanda Dillon has men dropping at her feet, but she discounts that as they are hypnotized at the time.  The one man she wants on his knees is Derek Armstrong.  Derek is a reporter and he is on the trail of the elusive Amanda and wants the scoop, even if he has to permit her to hypnotize him to get the down and dirty to prove Amanda is a scam artist.  This one sizzles, as Amanda doesn't quite know what to make of the sexy reporter.  A delightful tale.<br /><br />FUZZY LOGIC is by Erin McCarthy and is another enjoyable tale.  A bit more Brava style, this story has Ashley Andrew, confession shopaholic, is shocked when her credit cards are maxed to the limit and beyond.  She is forced to take on a second job to make payments on the massive debt.  She to accept a job as a Pleasure Party consultant.  She accidentally leaves her case of \"party favors\" on the doorstep of sexy next-door neighbor, Lucas Manning.  This story is a riot.  Ashley and Lucas are a sexy couple, but it's the witty laugh out loud humor as Lucas feels the need to make sure Ashley is prepared to peddle the pleasure toys.

So, Anton has the perfect person in mind he wants to pay to fulfill this stipulation. Cristina Marques. Though he has loathed her with a passion for six years, he still can't put out the sparks of passion he has for her. The last time they were together she callously ended their relationship and told him that under no circumstances she would bear his English children. Little did he know Cristina was spitting out empty words and trying to cover up her own secrets and pain. So, Anton goes back to England resenting what Cristina did to him and harbors bitter feelings towards her. Then the package comes and Anton sets a plan in motion. He neatly sets up a plan to get Cristina into a position that forces her to either accept his loan from his bank or lose her family home. The passion is definitely there between Cristina and Anton and Reid does a good job at giving both the heroine's and hero's POV. BUT there seemed to be an element missing in this book. Maybe it was because the reason for them breaking up could have been resolved in a different way and not dragged out for I think six years. Overall, this was a good read and it didn't drag on.	2005-09-30

Mr. Bidulka is an author who takes good care of his readers. He knows that he is there to entertain, at times baffle, amuse and stimulate the people who open his books - not through science or technical expertise or celebrity but through good old story telling. <br /> <br />By this third book I have come to know well that I can safely expect to have a good time with a Russell Quant mystery and  Mr. Bidulka knows how not to be a complacent writer - he delivers the goods we love without falling into the trap of repitition or staying within the comfortable mold he himself created - he always tries something new. This time he's taken us out of Saskatchewan (although he never forgets to add the subtle  tinges to remind us Russell is and always will be a Saskatchewan boy)and onto a cruise ship of luxury and murder.  <br /> <br />I was giddy with excitement when I read the teasers - a wealthy client the target of a greedy relative willing to murder for early inheritance - a shipful of suspects - all played out against the dazzling backdrop of the salty ports of the Mediterranean. And he brings it on. Imagine the Love Boat meets Hercule Poirot meets Queer as Folk meets the Travel Channel. Mr. Bidulka brings it all, treating his reader to a challenging whodunit with more than one twist, a dash of tenderness, a speckle of tragedy, and more than a splash of excitement and good humor.  <br /> <br />I so enjoy these books, I just really enjoy them - good fun unpretentious entertainment with smidgens of complexity that make for good thinking long after the last page is turned.	2005-09-30

Cherlyn Michaels, Counting Raindrops Through a Stained-Glass Window (Archland, 2004)<br /><br />A quick websearch and about five minutes of research turned up the fact that Michaels herself created Archland Press. Therefore, this is self-publishing, not vanity publishing, and thus that particular flavor of tar can't come out with the feathers. The problem is, all the shortcomings of vanity publishing show up with self-published works, and so they end up usually being only a step above vanity work.<br /><br />Counting Raindrops Through a Stained Glass Window has a relatively good idea for a romance novel: heroine (who is, of course, smart, sexy, and self-assured) has the perfect relationship. She's seen so many marriages go down the drain that she's unwilling to make the final commitment. Boyfriend (who is, of course, an Adonis who can cook) wants to propose. Heroine keeps finding ways to halt the conversation, while her friends are telling her to go for it. Resolve, of course, must crack. It's a romance, everyone's gotta end up happy (and preferably married); the fun of romance novels is the journey taken to get there. And thus, in romance novels, as in any genre fiction, it's doubly important that the journey at least be well-written enough to keep the interest of the reader.<br /><br />And here's the problem with self-publishing and it's ugly cousin vanity publishing: in this case, it's not. It doesn't even come close. Every time Michaels gets herself into a rhythm, she drops in something that seems as if it were cut out of a marketing brochure, rather than pulled from a romance writer's quiver. Her tone changes in the space of a sentence from romantic to didactic, then back again. It's awkward, and even the most entry-level editor at a major press (or even a small-but-on-the-rise press; BET's publishing arm seems as if it would've been a natural fit) would have immediately flagged huge sections of this manuscript, mandating the tone be changed to fit with the rest of the material. Unfortunately, without the advice of an editor, the book stayed in what reads like rough draft form, and showcases the differences between an author's first draft and a publishable piece of work. Other awkward errors can be found as well, such as using an abbreviation and then spelling out what the abbrevation means the second time, rather than the first, it's used:<br /><br />\"While I was the only one in the lobby at the Cleveland Growth Association's COSE office, the phone was lit up like Times Square....The coffee table held a spread of information provided by the Consortium of Small Emterprises (COSE).\" For the record, there's roughly half a page covered by that ellipsis.<br /><br />Coincidentally, as I write this, the book has been picked up and reprinted by Hyperion. It might be worth comparing the two editions to see if there were changes to some of the text to make it a better read. I'm reviewing from the first printing, however, and I have to say to avoid this one like the plague. (zero)he rest of the material.

I purchased this book at an airport during a layover, basically because I'd finished my other book and it looked decent.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting much because I hadn't heard anything about this author or about the book, and I barely looked at the book before I bought it.  I was amazed at how quickly I was pulled in to the characters' lives<br /><br />The friendship between Darcy and Rachel is so well written, and the author obviously knows her demographic, because I think all of us can relate with a similar BFF relationship.  I actually find myself thinking of friendships I had when I was a child.  She has also developed the main characters so well that you feel as if you know them.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that you will ever sympathize with a woman who sleeps with her best friend's fiance, but believe me, you will!  Emily Giffin gives the character of Rachel such a conscience, and makes the reader hope for Rachel to have a good outcome out of all of this.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down and as soon as I did, it was to order the sequel, Something Blue.	2005-09-29

He takes on the issues of Glen Canyon Dam, Lake Powell, and the Navajo Generating Station, though much of his information on the Navajo Generating Station is now extremely out of date.<br />He examines everything from the desert to walking to why people bother doing anything, always with his trademark sense of bitter humor.<br />On walking he says, \"The iron tug of gravitation should be all the reminder we need that in walking uphill we are violating a basic law of nature.\"<br />On reasons for climbing mountains he says, \"George H.

In between, the authors discuss the history and the mathematical concepts at an elementary level, hoping that the book may serve as a first textbook of graph theory. I think it could serve this purpose very well. There is a lot of focus on the puzzle-style origins of graph theory, starting with marvelous 18th century classics of Euler and Vandermonde and then including many other charming little topics like for instance a very nice 1895 paper of Tarry on how to find your way out of a maze. There are also topics from other fields (e.g. chemistry), but here I think the background discussions are a bit weak. Something like half the book is centred around the four-colour problem, which is historically faithful and necessary, but it is obviously disturbing that the book ends long before this problem was solved.	2005-09-29

Perhaps she was right. After all, how can meloukhia, a green soup indigenous to the Middle East and particularly associated with Egyptian cuisine, be considered (of all things) \"Jewish\"?<br /><br />Equally disturbing for me was the experience of hunting the book down on a trip to the States a few months ago. As I prowled through the bookstores of Washington DC and New York, I came across countless books on what was obviously Middle Eastern cuisine filed on shelves labelled in large letters, \"Jewish Cooking\".<br /><br />When I talked about reviewing this book with my colleagues, we were struck by how taboo the whole subject felt. Political correctness -- on both sides of the divide -- has long obliterated any acknowledgment of common history; whence so many crude attempts to appropriate recipes as if they belonged to only a single people's story. For to study food is to come to terms with a whole society. And it is politics -- the creation of Israel, the many wars of the ensuing Arab-Israeli conflict, the occupation of Palestine and the continuing violence against the Palestinian people -- that constantly gets in the way to prevent us reaching a clear understanding of what Egyptian society was like before the Tripartite Aggression of 1956. A time when the Jews were an integral part of \"us\".<br /><br />Roden's book, which received this year's James Beard Foundation Cookbook of the Year award, stands against the ravages of modern history. It is less a cook book than a literary tapestry, in which food and memory are equally important ingredients. It tells a story which embraces not only the kitchens of the Jewish communities of Cairo, Baghdad and Aleppo, but the texture of social life, there and in many other countries spanning the divide between Asia and Europe. \"At 16 Woodstock Road it seemed that we had never left Cairo,\" Roden writes of her parents' house in London. \"The smell of sizzling garlic and crushed coriander seeds in the kitchen, or of rose water in a pudding, and my mother's daily meals reinforced the feeling.\"<br /><br />Roden was born and raised in Cairo. It was a cosmopolitan life, centred in Zamalek amongst an affluent and privileged French-speaking community. \"When I look through the old notes and recipes given by relatives and friends soon after they left Egypt,\" she remembers, \"it rekindles memories of our old life in a vivid way... There is 'kobeba Latifa', 'fromage blanc Adele', 'Hamud Sophie'....\"<br /><br />Her two grandfathers came from Aleppo, Syria, and her great-grandfather Haham Abraham ha Cohen Douek was the chief rabbi of the city. One prized family heirloom is a photo of the Haham wearing medals given to him by the Sultan Abdel-Hamid II. But she also inherited from him a recipe for kibbeh : \"Their cooking was Aleppan. It was considered the pearl of the Arab kitchen -- refined and delicate... Their crowning glory was kibbeh, which was a world in itself, with dozens of varieties. Basically, it had an outer shell of pounded wheat and meat, and a spicy meat-and- onion filling. The apartment [of her paternal grandfather in Sakakini] resounded constantly with the ring of the metal pestle and mortar with which they pounded the meat and wheat. It smelled of mint and spices and sizzling lamb, of tamarind and orange blossom.\"<br /><br />Roden and her family belonged to a community, based in Cairo and Alexandria, which had its roots in Egypt, even as it absorbed waves of immigrants from many different places. \"We gave ourselves the fictional bane of'Basramite' to characterise our mixed backgrounds. There were the Arabised inhabitants of the Haret Al-Yahoud -- the Jewish quarter of Cairo, which we called the hara or simply le quartier, and which was built as early as 389 -- and of the equally ancient Souq Al-Samak (fish market) in Alexandria.\" In the 16th century the descendants of Jews from the Iberian Peninsula arrived, and later in the 19th century they were joined by Jews from Salonika, Smyrna, Istanbul, the Balkans and North Africa. Already in the Middle Ages, there were immigrants from Yemen and North Africa, and even a few Ashkenazim, escapees from the pogroms in Russia and Eastern Europe. Not to mention the Italians, the Iraqis or the Syrians...<br /><br />The stories of these people are interwoven with the 800 or so recipes Roden has compiled. \"Part of the appeal for me of working on this book is that there is more to Jewish food than cooking and eating. Behind every recipe is a story of local traditions and daily life in far-off towns and villages. It is a romantic and nostalgic subject which has to do with recalling a world that has vanished.\" And so a recipe for Semolina and Coconut Sabbath Cake of the Bene Israel, a cake eaten for breakfast on Saturday by the Jews in India, Riso coi Carciofi (rice with artichokes), a dish originating in the Venice Ghetto, Khoreshte Gheimeh (meat and yellow split pea sauce for rice), a favourite of the Iranian community, and Agneau aux Feves Vertes et aux Amandes (lamb with fresh fava beans and almonds), an ancient Berber dish served between Purim and Pesah in Morocco, all come together to define the mosaic that is Jewish history.<br /><br />Yet Roden herself has also grappled with the question as to whether these recipes can truly be defined as \"Jewish food\". In the introduction to this cookbook, she quotes from a paper she gave at the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery in 1981: \"There is really no such thing as Jewish food. What is familiar here [in England] as Jewish food is totally unknown to the Jew of Egypt, Morocco and India. Local regional food becomes Jewish when it travels with Jews to new homelands.\" She goes on to explain that since Jews started coming out of the Middle East, India and Georgia in the mid-1950s, they brought with them what is to Ashkenazi cooking a \"bewildering range of 'Jewish' dishes\".<br /><br />After much research, Roden has concluded that \"Jews have adopted the foods of the countries they lived in, but in every country their cooking has had a special touch and taste and characteristic features and some entirely original dishes, which have made it distinctive and recognisable.\" She goes on to explain that the need for recipes to comply with Jewish dietary law (with its prohibition on combining meat and dairy foods, as well as the refusal of pork and seafood) and the centrality of food to religious festivals which themselves come with specific dietary requirements (for example, at Passover no leavening agents may be used) have also helped give certain foods their Jewish character. Further, Roden argues that \"[T]here was always, even centuries ago, a touch of otherness in Jewish cooking, a cosmopolitanism which broke even through ghetto walls,\" and which reflects a long tradition of mobility across nations and borders.<br /><br />According to the Bible, the Jews longed for the foods they left behind in Egypt, and fava beans were one of the foods they hankered for the most during their Exodus. Roden therefore provides a Moroccan version of the recipe for bessara -- \"eaten at Passover, because 'that is what the Hebrews ate in Egypt'\". She notes that bessara has been a basic Egyptian food ever since the time of the Pharaohs. It continues to be a main staple of low-income households, and is also a particular favourite of my husband's. And while we all consume copious amounts of the green paste, we remain oblivious to the fact that we share our bessara passion with a significant part of the Jewish people.<br />[...]cal regional food becomes Jewish when it travels with Jews to new homelands.\" She goes on to explain that since Jews started coming out of the Middle East, India and Georgia in the mid-1950s, they brought with them what is to Ashkenazi cooking a \"bewildering range of 'Jewish' dishes\".

Of course he doesn't state it exactly like that. His claim is that slick puppeteers in the Republican leadership have ridden to power by cynically stoking the flames of a culture war they don't care about, in order to divert attention from their real ambition, which is to reconfigure the U.S. economy so that it redistributes income from the poor and the middle class to the rich. They've created a bitter antipathy among middle Americans toward the cultural elite ensconced on the coasts so that, too blinded by their indignation at not having their solid virtues lauded by the liberal establishment, these gullible Midwesterners won't see that the very politicians who claim to share their worldview are playing them for fools. The epicenter of this phenomenon, according to Mr. Frank, is Kansas.    In Frank's telling, it's not the coastal elites who disdain middle America, but Kansans themselves and other \"red-staters\" who are filled with contempt toward the liberal \"blue-staters\" who don't share their commitment to loyalty, reverence, and a solid work ethic. Media bias and liberal cultural elitism are simply bogeymen created by the Right in order to give it a coherent enemy. As Frank puts it, \"liberal bias exists because it must exist in order for the rest of contemporary conservatism to be true.\"     As a matter of fact, it is Frank not conservative Kansans who can't comprehend the real motives that animate political action. Take, for example, Senator Brownback's opposition to embryonic stem cell research. This is a moral position, which the senator derives from his faith. It is not a clearly partisan issue, although more Republicans than Democrats are opposed. At the same time, a number of Republican leaders favor federal support for stem cell research. This is an issue, remember, that Frank dismisses as \"purely symbolic.\" And yet, this is an issue with immediate and pressing economic consequences-and the profits are on the side of favoring, not opposing, stem cell research. Just across the river from Kansas, Missourians are currently grappling with the issue of whether or not to ban embryonic stem cell research. The prestigious Stowers Institute, a cancer research center, has publicly warned that if Missouri passes a stem cell ban, they will not build their planned 600,000 square-foot research facility in the state. Whether one agrees or disagrees with stem-cell research, it is clear that there is no profit to be made in opposing it, and a great deal of money on the side of supporting it. Yet Mr. Frank cannot comprehend this, because it does not fit in to his paradigm of the relationship between economic and moral motives...    ...As a matter of fact, it is Frank not conservative Kansans who can't comprehend the real motives that animate political action.

Yet Mr. Frank cannot comprehend this, because it does not fit in to his paradigm of the relationship between economic and moral motives.    This envious opposition to cultural elitism reveals itself foremost in a fundamental anti-intellectualism. Thus, Frank argues, the fervor of the anti-abortion movement arises not from a legitimate conviction that innocent life is being sacrificed; rather, it is \"its power as an anti-intellectual rallying point\" that accounts for the centrality of the pro-life cause among social conservatives. So convinced is he that only class resentment can explain the strength of the movement that he finds it difficult even to comprehend how pro-lifers can equate their movement to the anti-slavery movement of the 1850's.    Now, for most people, this is not too hard to understand: in both movements, those who sought to protect innocent human life from a culture that devalued it were considered beyond the pale of political discourse because they disturbed the court-mandated compromise with evil that allowed politics as usual to continue. Although this parallel has been drawn by a number of people-most famously, perhaps, by George McKenna in a cover article in the Atlantic in 1995-Frank just doesn't get it. At first, he decides that it's just a way for pro-lifers to call pro-choicers names. But then he applies his construct that resentment is the key to everything. Doing this, he finds a way to reclaim the historical high ground from the pro-life movement and to link them, not with the abolitionists, but with the backwoods pro-slavery \"Bushwackers\" of Missouri who violently opposed the settlement of Kansas as a free state. According to Frank, both contemporary pro-lifers and the Bushwackers felt themselves to be despised by the cultural elite of the day; therefore, they're both the same.    It actually is this focus on resentment that is the key to unlocking Thomas Frank's entireunderstanding of politics. After all, his focus on economics doesn't really make too much sense. It's based on the premise that conservative policies actually are bad for ordinary people, and the evidence just isn't there to support that argument. In fact, Kansas, that reddest of red states, is doing better than the rest of the country on most major economic indicators. So, Frank has constructed a paradigm so powerful that he can't see beyond it even when it is directly contrary to fact, all to explain the solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Why?    The answer comes in the book's autobiographical section. As a true-believing conservative in high-school and young adulthood, Frank's conversion to liberalism came about, not through seeing for himself the effects of poverty, nor through economic arguments that convinced him of the error of his ways, but rather as the result of being snubbed by former high-school classmates, who came from wealthier families than his, who wouldn't talk to him after they pledged the elite fraternities at the University of Kansas. When he realized that he was not going to be selected to a leadership position among the college Republicans at KU: \"I did a very un-Kansan thing: I started voting Democratic.\" In other words, and by his own admission, because young Frank's political identity sprang from his resentment of the popular kids, he has decided that everybody else must also make their political choices on the same basis.     Truly pathetic.     (excerpts from the incomparable : (...)	2005-09-29

It's not only one of the best books about movies I have ever read, it really gives you a feeling for the times. It's smart, beautifully written and fun to read. If you're a fan of James Dean or Rebel Without a Cause you'll find a lot in here you probably didn't know before.

In particular, he uses both experimental research results and experience from his own pediatric practice, so the information seems reliable and applicable to real life.  He also covers the entire age range of childhood and is specific about what should be occurring at each age.  He breaks this down by weeks and months in infancy, which is very helpful.   <br /> <br />So, why only three stars?  Because it takes a great deal of time and effort to find the needed information.   <br /> <br />First, he repeats key ideas in different places in varying amounts of detail, so it's hard to know where to look to understand your child's sleep problems and develop an action plan. Sometimes he briefly mentions things that are discussed in more detail later, but doesn't provide a page or section reference for where to look for the details.   <br /> <br />Second, he bends over backwards to accommodate different parenting styles (primarily how much crying the parents will tolerate).  This is a good thing, but it also makes it confusing to figure out what to do because so many alternatives and contingencies are included in every suggestion.   <br /> <br />Third, he doesn't use enough charts and diagrams to provide information at a glance.  I would have liked to see a summary chart with different age babies, what is going on in terms of sleep, and what parents should be doing to establish healthy habits at that age.  Also, he describes a sleep log, which has time of day on the vertical axis and day of the week on the horizontal axis, with bars showing sleeping periods during each day.  It's a great idea!  However, he doesn't provide ANY examples of what this actually looks like.  I would have liked to see extensive examples used to illustrate what is typical at different ages and what various unhealthy patterns look like.	2005-09-29

On one level this is a fairly well laid-out, well organized exposition of the various legal philosophies in America (and Western Society) from a certain moderate viewpoint.  Sunstein claims to be a judicial minimalist, and I've heard him plead this case several times on NPR.  He makes himself out to be the true agent of judicial restraint. <br /> <br />On the other hand, you have to wonder though...  Is it just me, or is there something untoward about those who generally like the output of the Earl Warren Court suddenly embracing the doctrine of judicial restraint?  Does it seem to you that, now that they have numerous verdicts they like, it is time for them to embrace restraint in order to defend that Warren court legacy?  (Let's face the fact folks, this argument is all about the Warren court legacy.) <br /> <br />Although Sunstein generally scolds the \"Perfectionists\" (Leftist civil rights lawyers) for trying to super-legislate change through the courts, you don't get the sense that he's concerned about that.  Sunstein is much more concerned with protecting their legacy from conservative reversal-minded justices.  This is a funny position to take given the fact that he doesn't like how \"Perfectionists\" attained their goals in the first place. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  I don't find this guy a credible witness.  I think it is a nice political move by the Left to embrace judicial restraint at a time when they can't appoint any Justices to the Supreme Court.  \"Now that we got what we want let's call a time-out from Judicial Activism until we can get the Presidency back.\"	2005-09-29

Konstantinos' \"Nocturnicon\" is sure to ignite a firestorm of controversy among magickal circles. This is not for \"armchair occultists\" afraid to try anything new, nor for anyone afraid of the Dark. Indeed, this ground-breaking tome embraces the darkness.  <br /> <br />This book was a workbook of methods that saved the author's own life under dire circumstances, a highly personal and introspective time that he's sharing with readers. The Hadetic magickal path developed here steps out of the safety of magickally-cast circles, makes liberal use of psychodrama, and defiantly treads onto paths not covered by other occult books. Dark forces and dark powers are conjured that may be uncomfortable to some, downright frightening to others, or even exhilarating to the daring.  <br /> <br />Previously taboo subjects are put into a candid spotlight, including altered states, sex magick, death magick, the alchemical history of Chartreuse, an in-depth look at H.P. Lovecraft's Chtulu mythos, and other mysteries. \"Nocturnicon\" brings occult elements that have been available from, say, ancient Greece and everything since, and kicks the knowledge, abilities, and techniques into the future. The absolute highlight of the book is the author's personal encounter with the misunderstood Light Bearer himself!  <br /> <br />This book is a fresh, new metaphysical journey. Even if the reader chooses not to experiment with any of the rituals or methods in this book, it still makes one Hell of a fascinating read! Explore these pages - if you dare! <br />	2005-09-29

The book includes a very good chapter on how to read rhythm (probably the biggest challenge to newcomers of Brazilian style guitar), and chapters on chord construction and progressions.  David Marshall's writing style is informal and friendly.  He covers some music theory -- as it relates to the Brazilian guitar -- in a comprehensible, non-intimidating manner.  He includes numerous rhythmic examples written in standard notation and tab, along with a CD to help you learn those difficult patterns.  The latter half of the book consists of fifteen solos written in standard notation only (no tab).  The solos range from moderate-beginner to intermediate in difficulty.   <br /> <br />For anyone interested in pursuing the Brazilian jazz style, \"The Brazilian Guitar Book\" by Nelson Faria is a good place to continue after working through the Marshall book.  Faria's instruction is  more comprehensive, but geared more towards the advanced-intermediate guitar player. <br /> <br />I was very impressed with the well-structured layout of \"Learn to Play Jazz Guitar\".  Marshall obviously loves this type of guitar playing, and manages to convey his enthusiasm and expertise to the reader.  Studying from this book is almost comparable to attending private lessons with a competent Brazilian guitarist.  Highly recommended.	2005-09-29

It is making a big difference in my life, in how I process my thoughts, and consequently, in how I feel. <br />I think the title is so apropos because I do indeed feel like I am moving through walls I had assumed were impermeable.  I would prefer the book without some of the religious language. <br />I have my own concept of a Higher Power and do not want anyone else telling me how to think about God or giving me specific prayers. I am learning to distinguish my ego, fear-based voice from my higher power's love-based voice - and this is making an enormous difference. The book is redundant - but I'm finding that helpful and not disturbing.  Every lesson leaves me feeling that I am receiving new insights - honesty, tolerance, etc. - concepts I only thought I understood before.  I am very grateful to have come upon this book.	2005-09-29

This is an excellent study for everyone, whether you are interested in the place of women in the church, Jewish or other ancient cultures, Greek or Hebrew exegesis, or church history. The book may look uninviting at first because of the type, but it has paragraph headings and a terrific index that enables you to dip into it anywhere your curiosity leads, and hook you into reading the whole thing. <br />    If you are traditionally minded and committed to Biblical authority, this is especially for you. This is an old book from 1923. Bushnell felt called to preach but didn't believe women were allowed to. She insisted God show her in the Bible that it was ok. This study was the result. While her conclusions are good, you may not agree with every interpretation she gives. There are some better explanations of some of Paul's passages about women in more modern books, but Bushnell really shines in her study of Genesis and ancient cultures.  Here is info you won't easily find anywhere else unless it is quoted from her.  <br />   This book will be appreciated most by those interested in looking at the big picture instead of 'straining at gnats.' Remember to always interpret Bible passages according to the  context of the whole story of Israel and the Early Church -- in which women are always treated as having individual rights and value by God and godly people. (See especially Dorothy Sayers' humorous but pointed little book 'Are Women Human?') <br />  For instance, you can (mis)interpret some individual verses to try to show women are their husband's or father's virtual slaves and have little rights, authority, or ministry except thru them, but you will never see this played out in a Bible story, where women speak and  are spoken to directly by God, and are asked to make decisions by Him, or make requests of Him, without getting anyone's permission first, not to mention they become famous mothers, leaders, prophets, judges, and apostles/missionaries. Jesus took great pains to violate all of the Pharisees' prejudices about women (even allowing them to travel with Him-- how radical was that?), but some in the church want to revive all of their ideas. Bushnell shows that the Pharisees' ideas had no basis in the Old Testament. (She doesn't cover the fact that alot of anti - women ideas came from Persia and Greece into post-exile Jewish culture.) <br />   This doesn't mean women should not be dedicated mothers and wives -- Bushnell was single, I believe. ALL Christians, male or female, 'clergy' or not, must manage their families well and not neglect them for what they think is God's work. You either involve your family in your ministry or work with the 'free' time you have in the season of life you are in. And God may call you to stay single and devote yourself to only Him!	2005-09-29

The Red Rover by James Fenimore Cooper could (or rather should, in my opinion) be classified as the definitive pirate story. Set in a time in which wars frequented the then infant american nation and when men were still civil towards one another regardless of apparent violent intentions or differences, this excellent master piece tells of adventurers upon the high seas and progresses beyond that into a simple plot which unravels itself masterfully.  <br /> <br />It is indeed a sad fact that books like these are becoming more scarce upon our bookshelves.	2005-09-29

After all, the eruption of Krakatoa was one of the most important events of the past millennium, and yet most people know nothing about it.  But Simon Winchester took this rich, interesting topic and somehow made it about himself.  I was truly absorbed by his theory that modern Islamic fundamentalism could be traced to Indonesian fury over the Dutch reaction to the eruption.  Facts like that were incredibly good.  But I could do without Winchester going on about his youth as a rock collector or whatnot. This book could have been a great one if it weren't for the writer being so impressed with himself.  Instead, it's a great book only when the writer really gets down to business and digs into the topic.  In that 75%, it's fantastic. And it made me think not a few times of the recent tsunami.	2005-09-28
US	49055185	R1NMHPP6OFJHQG	0812505182	465915454	The Magic of Recluce (Recluce series, Book 1)	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Interesting twists on fantasy standards	I love this book.<br /><br />Modesitt takes all the standard elements of fantasy - the medieval setting, the young man going out into the world, magic, etc - and gives them new and unique twists.  The young hero, for example, typically goes out into the world on a huge quest to save the world.  In this book, he's exiled.  (The only spoiler in my review, I swear - and it happens very early in the book).  No saving the world, no protecting the innocents back home who have no idea what's going on.  The folks back home know exactly what's going on, and he's not saving them from it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed seeing the way he took the trappings and made them his own.  The order versus chaos conflict (which is more fully developed in other books) feels much more like a real conflict than the typical good versus pure evil.  Each side sees itself as good, just as in most human conflicts each side sees itself as good.<br /><br />The rules of the magic are clear and well developed throughout the series, with relatively few mysteries left unexplained.  (Except the black staff - we never really find out why that terrifies everyone).  You get a pretty clear idea of what a magic user can do and can't do, which gives the series a sense of being more firmly grounded than a lot of fantasy series, where it seems there is a new rule about magic users for every situation.<br /><br />I have to admit though, the character of Lerris really bugged me after a while.  But Justin was a fascinating enough character that it more than made up for Lerris's whining.<br /><br />This isn't a great choice as your first fantasy series, since I think it will appeal far more to those of us who know the conventions, have read Tolkien, Eddings, martin, and Jordan, and know how these things usually play out.  But if you've read the usual suspects, this is an engaging riff of the fantasy genre.	2005-09-28

Unlike so many other authors of books on marketing, he devotes less time to principles (albeit sound ones) and more time to explain how and why effective application of those principles can help any organization (regardless of its size or nature) to create or increase demand for whatever it sells. I am among those who believe that literally everyone involved in a given enterprise should be actively involved in marketing. That is, take advantage of appropriate opportunities to help promote their company among family members, neighbors, friends, casual acquaintances, and even people whom they meet by chance. True, not all of those thus encountered are prospective buyers but most (if not all) of them know others who are. As Emanuel Rosen has explained so brilliantly in Anatomy of Buzz, a company's employees comprise its single most important (and least expensive) resource for word-of-mouth marketing (i.e. BUZZ). They can and should be actively involved in a \"campaign\" under inspiring leadership, once having been properly prepared.<br /><br />All of the 14 \"real-life\" marketing plans which Johnson presents illustrate how to organize, launch, and then expedite an effective marketing campaign. For those who already have extensive experience in marketing, much of the material provided will no doubt be familiar. However, who knows? There may be some helpful reminders as well as an occasional insight or two of direct relevance. For others, Johnson provides a step-by-step analysis of twelve different plans which offer a range and depth of strategies and tactics to consider.<br /><br />One caveat: Valuable as books such as these can be, it would be a serious mistake to depend almost entirely on it or any other single source of information and counsel. Whatever and wherever it may be, a given competitive marketplace is necessarily messy and often volatile. Change is the only constant. Therefore, I strongly recommend that a variety of sources be consulted.<br /><br />I also presume to suggest that, more often than not, the most valuable source consists of those with whom you now do business. What do they most appreciate about what you offer? What do they consider most valuable in their relationship with you? What are their own needs (especially unmet needs), interests, fears, concerns, and (yes) \"dreams\"? What more can you do? What can you do better? Obtain answers to questions such as these and you will already be well along toward knowing how to \"supercharge\" your marketing initiatives.I also presume to suggest that, more often than not, the most valuable source consists of those with whom you now do business.

I've read them all from Dan Kennedy to Jay Abraham.  But what Steve Harper puts down in the ripple effect goes beyond simple marketing.   <br /> <br />This book is a life lesson.  In a time when cutthroat marketing and hard selling is in vogue, Harper spells out a very simple maxim \"Helping others and creating positive relationships IS good for business\".   <br /> <br />But this is no pie-in-the-sky-let's-just-love-one-another book.  It is a practical guide for building a successful business.  The truth is that the relationship-oriented marketing strategy or as Harper puts it, \"ripple creation\" has been proven to get results time and time again.   <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.  If you're interested in building a strong business, read this book and implement Harper's relationship-building strategies.  I implemented just one strategy and am already seeing positive reults in business and in life.	2005-09-28

On Fraser's Ridge, North Carolina Jamie Fraser already knows the outcome of the Revolutionary War because his spouse Claire told him having journeyed from the future to his past knowing the details about the Revolutionary War because she read about it in the American history books.<br /><br />Tension is high so Colonial Governor Tryon asks Jamie, leader of those residing along Fraser Ridge, to help keep the peace there.  He is not sure how to respond because Jamie knows that those who support the monarchy will either die or flee in exile yet Jamie still hopes he can avoid bloodshed.  There is also the matter of knowing that three plus years from now The Wilmington Gazette December 1776 reports that Jamie and his family died in a fire.  Jamie knows that the devil is in the details, but how can a mortal change history even if the events have not yet occurred. Now in 1773 he must take sides knowing that soon people he cares about will die.<br /><br />The latest Gabaldon time travel historical tale is a superb entry because of the dilemmas facing the hero who knows the outcome of the upcoming war and is aware of the deaths of himself and his beloved family yet must make difficult choices.  For instance, perhaps he should relocate elsewhere so that the Frasers and others are nowhere near the mid December 1776 inferno, but that also means neglecting his responsibilities.  Jamie, Claire, and the others are at their best when knowing what is coming, but sometimes an ethical person must choose a losing perhaps deadly position.  Ms. Gabaldon is at her epic best with this powerful saga. The paragraphs above fail to even hint at the vast deep look at North Carolina on the verge of war because it is impossible to describe the scope of this work in a few paragraphs.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-09-28

Based on scrolls purportedly smuggled out of Iran following the 2003 earthquake, the author weaves the ancient story of Queen Esther with excerpts and information from the New York Times, the BBC, the FBI and other contemporary sources.<br /><br />This story is told in the voice of Queen Esther and relayed in her own hand through a series of diary entries. Her journey from marketplace urchin to Queen of Persia is more satisfying than a fairy tale. Unlike Cinderella, who endured a similar make-over, Esther did not desire to visit the palace. At least not through the door that led to the harem!<br /><br />I have never been to Persia, but after reading Chosen, I can imagine what it looks like. I can hear ancient sounds ringing through my ears and smell the scents of the region's cuisine. From descriptions of the marketplace Esther grew up in, to the harem she became a part of, to the palace she came to rule, the author's research is exhaustive and evocative. This novel truly creates a world out of words. And in reading it, I felt as if I was watching over Esther's shoulder, a constant observer of her actions and emotions.<br /><br />I especially appreciated Ginger's approach to the question of the worth of women in an ancient society. She could have either dodged the question completely or re-written history to create the sort of anachronistic and modern `spunky' heroine which seems to inhabit the majority of recent `historicals'. Instead, the author chose to leave Queen Esther in the context of her time and in doing so, provided keen observations on what life was like as a woman. Both the positives (yes, there were some) and the negatives.<br /><br />Ginger sweeps the sands of time from this figure of ancient history, giving her voice once again -- and what a compelling voice it is!. Expect this shrouded figure of ancient history to lend her vision to her contemporary sisters.<br /><br />This is a book with staying power and Ginger Garrett is an author to watch!--I look forward to her forthcoming books.r to watch!--I look forward to her forthcoming books. <br />	2005-09-28

In this book, a family struggles at the loss of their oldest daughter, Jazz.  Everyone that is, except for her sister Sunny, who never liked Jazz.  Then one day, Sunny, opens the mailbox and retrieves a letter that would forever change her life and the lives around her.  The letter was from her sister-her dead sister.  The letter told how Jazz had been out of town that very same weekend that her apartment complex had burned to the ground.  She went on to tell how she would be returning home that weekend, and she did.  However, when she arrived, everyone knew this wasn't their Jazz.  Not the Jazz they all knew and loved.  Was this girl a fake or was this girl really their Jazz? <br /> Some things I liked about Dead Girls Don't Write Letters, is how the book kept you guessing what was going to happen next.  Another thing I liked about this book was how instantly everyone could sense something was different about the girl that had come back into their lives after being dead for over a month.  I liked this because it made you get the feeling that this was a close family.  Some things I didn't like about the book was the ending.  The ending had very little detail and was somewhat confusing.   <br /> Some people who might like this book are people who like to read.  I thought this because if you don't like to read you aren't going to like this book.  This book is so good that you never want to put it down, so therefore, you have to like to read a lot because I could never put this book down. I always wanted to know what was going to come next and who this girl was that came into their lives as their sister.  Was she really their beloved Jazz, or was she someone else just trying to be Jazz?  You also might like this book if you like books that keep you guessing.  With this book, it kept me guessing with every turning page.  You might also like this book if you like a little bit of mystery.  I think this because this book has a lot of mystery with it when the girl arrives.  I haven't read any books by this author, nor, have I read any other books that were similar to this type of book.  It is a kind of book that I'm sure you'll enjoy!    <br />	2005-09-28

The Lost Letters of Pergamum are in fact pure fiction, but the underlying truth is that there were far more letters going around the ancient world than we often realise.  To think that Paul and the other apostles only wrote the handful we still have stretches credulity.<br /><br />This is also an interesting and creative way of introducing biblical issues of interpretation.  We take for granted the histories written based upon letters in the New Testament and other similar writings - actual history texts were few and far between, particularly when it comes to early Christianity.  The few references in major historians of the time show how seemingly insignificant the original Christian community was in context of the time.<br /><br />Longenecker begins in earnest with the idea that there has been a discovery of lost letters (akin to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls - indeed, the discovery of New Testament writings would be a major event).  Antipas, who is mentioned in the book of the Revelation to John, died as a martyr in the city of Peramum, in Asia Minor, but not before being subject of a good volume of correspondence.  Antipas is a correspondent with the gospel writer Luke, and also keeps his own sort of journal or record of events.  These are laid out in an interesting development that shows the growth of faith, practice, and ultimate call to martyrdom, as was not uncommon in the early church.<br /><br />Longenecker introduces interesting historical items in the course of the correspondence and journals.  For example, one of the charges against Christians by the Romans was that they were atheists - while this may seem a strange thing to charge Christian believers with today, in fact what the Roman authorities meant by this was that the Christians didn't honour the Roman gods.  While the Jews had a special dispensation to permit them not to worship Roman gods, this was not a general trend (and caused suspicion against the Jews, too).  When the gods include the ruling elite of the empire, to refuse to worship them borders on treasonous activity.<br /><br />Longenecker borrows from the scholarship of Ben Witherington III, prolific writer and New Testament scholar, to flesh out some of the details.  There is an appendix at the end of the volume that organises the facts from the fictional aspects, so that the careful reader can be certain as to what was wholly created for this narrative, and what has a stronger basis in fact.  Descriptions of urban life, rural life, economic situations, political figures and more are all drawn from historical documents and analyses.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book, done in a style so as to enhance the appreciation of the reader of biblical texts for the kind of material that he or she is reading.  This is good for the general reader as well as for study groups, youth groups, and classroom texts.is was not a general trend (and caused suspicion against the Jews, too).

Dr. Keith Ablow writes a gripping and compelling analysis of the psychology of not only Scott Peterson, but of the family tragedy and dysfunction that created Scott; dating back generations.<br /><br />The book is written in a very conversational non-clinical style.  It's as if one were sitting down with brandy after a satisfying meal, to discuss the Peterson case with a learned friend.  Interspersed with acknowledged facts are fanciful ruminations of  \"what if...\" and \"his mind may have thought...\".  Dr. Ablow asserts that for Scott, birth equals death, and the murder of Laci was as good as accomplished the moment she became pregnant.  It is fascinating to read of the series of horrific events visited on this family beginning with the murder of Scott's grandfather in December of 1945. From that point forward, Decembers became twisted re-visitations and amplifications of pain, loss, and death.  Dr Ablow details how Scott was psychologically strangled and dehumanized from the moment his life began. \" He was not really a person\".  The parallels are uncanny. As an example:  Scott was born with respiratory difficulties and spent the first days of his life isolated away from his mother in a plastic incubator, gasping to breathe. Connor died in the womb, struggling with lack of oxygenated blood because his mother Laci was dead.<br /><br />None of this in any way excuses what Scott Peterson did. His sociopathic behavior is terrifying and the jury found it deserving of the death penalty. But it is useful to understand how trauma begets trauma.  Dr Ablow challenges us to break cycles of violence. \"We have the capacity to heal one another. We also have the capacity to destroy one another\". This book should speak in broader tones to all of us, to examine our own lives and determine which of our actions will affect the future for the better, and which for the worse.	2005-09-28

A good inspirational design book if you're interested in reusing an old barn for modern day use and staying within the original design. The text is interesting and informative with the accompanying photos following along with the text. The pictures are overall excellent, sharp, clear, in detail and professionally done, with very very few exceptions. Some buildings are shown with structural  drawings that help visualize the internal timber frame or stone structure with the accompanying photogaphs. The authors seems to be a die hard traditionalist, very critical and at times mildly insulting to designers that chose to remodel the old barns in the modern way and deviating from what the original builders did. But at times understanding that the modern style  is a better fate than total destruction of a old old structure.	2005-09-28

It focuses on three very different girls: straight A Lisa, practical joker Stevie, and horse crazy Carole who become friends after Lisa begins riding at Pine Hollow. At first, Stevie and Carole aren't sure Lisa will fit in, but she soon proves herself to have genuine potential and a desire to learn. When she helps Stevie do a math project to raise her gradese (and permit her to go on a horseback riding campout), the Saddle Club is born. <br /> <br />As a review mentioned, the book suffered by not exploring the characters' motivations. Lisa's mother and Veronica, the stable's spoiiled little rich girl, remain one dimensional.    <br />However, it is hard to believe an author who knows enough about horses to write a book would put an inexperienced young rider (Veronica) on a stallion. <br />	2005-09-28

The close of the story was definitely open-ended and left you with the impression that there should be more. The Chamber of Secrets picks up where the first left off and really pushes it into high gear.<br /><br />The story begins where Harry gets a mysterious warning not to return to Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft. Harry of course ignores this and starts into his second year of schooling. Everything you can imagine starts to go wrong and Harry begins to realize the validity of the warning.<br /><br />On Halloween night, a message written in blood is found on a wall in Hogwarts, claiming that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. This starts yet another mystery for Harry and his friends, while they attempt to further their studies of wizardry.  Eventually they come to realize that an ancient terror is stalking the hallways of the school.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've cared this much for fictional characters. The old favorites are back: the logical Hermione, the poor but proud Ron Weasley, the slimy professor Snape, and of course the humble hero, Harry.  Plenty of new exciting personalities and places are also added to the mix. J.K. Rowling kept what was right about the first and vastly improved on it.	2005-09-28

People will still have to keep records, file income tax returns and get audited because the states and some cities will continue to have income taxes. There is no reason whatsoever to think that the states will get rid of their income taxes if the federal income tax is abolished. Quite the contrary, they are likely to view the federal government as co-opting their traditional tax basethe general sales tax. Therefore, the states will just take over the tax base being given up by the federal governmentthe income taxand abolish their state sales taxes, which would otherwise come on top of the NRST.    The only way this can be prevented is if the federal government prohibits the states from imposing income taxes at the same it abolishes the federal income tax, which is probably impossible constitutionally. And if the states keep their sales taxes, the federal government will have to force them to conform to its tax base. Right now, no two states have exactly the same sales tax systems and none come anywhere close to taxing sales as broadly as contemplated by the NRST.    2. There is a very severe problem of taxing business inputs under a sales tax. These must be exempt from tax in order to avoid cascadingtaxes being levied on taxeswhich creates serious economic distortions. To avoid this under a NRST, every business, no matter how small, would need some sort of exemption certificate, which would create unlimited opportunities for evasion, or they will have to be extensively audited in ways at least as onerous as under the income tax.    3. Services are by their nature much more difficult to tax than goods. For this reason, no state makes any effort to tax more than a few of them. Yet the NRST would tax 100 percent of services, including medical services and government services. Every time you go to the hospital you will have to pay 30 percent on top to the federal government. And local governments will also be taxed by the federal government on servicesthey provide, which will sharply raise property taxes.    4. In order to offset the regressivity of the NRST, it would establish a massive new government entitlement program costing hundreds of billions of dollars that would send rebate checks to every American on a monthly basis. This system would be based on the poverty level income established by the Census Bureau. People would get 23 percent of this amount annually in 12 monthly installments based on their family status. Quite apart from the massive complexity of this proposal, it would clearly require an enormous enforcement mechanism to avoid fraud and would undoubtedly be manipulated by politicians. It would be very tempting to change the formula to aid the poor and penalize the rich, just as the current tax code does.    5. Every serious analysis has concluded that a NRST would have massive evasion. Taxing the spending of drug dealers and others not currently paying income taxes will not come close to compensating for the new evasion opportunities that will be created. Since it is not in the interest of either retailers or consumers to pay the tax, and because all of the revenue is collected at the point of final sale, it will be too easy for tax-free deals to be made with producers and wholesalers.    Although evasion of state sales taxes is relatively small, that is only because the rates are low enough that it is not worth the trouble. However, where rates are high on things like tobacco, evasion is also high. A vast amount of foreign experience indicates that retail sales taxes cannot be collected much above 10 percent without breaking down.    Under our current tax system there is withholding of taxes on wages, which is the vast bulk of the tax base. Under a value-added tax (VAT), something similar occurs because taxes are paid at each point of the production-distribution system. Thus, if the retailer fails to collect the tax, only a small portion of the total revenue is lost, whereas with a NRST all of it would be lost. Primarily for this reason, every single country that has ever contemplated something like a NRST has instead chosen a VAT, which the NRST people oppose.	2005-09-28

I felt a little guilty about liking it as much as I did since it has been criticized as not being a first-rate piece of literature.  I was fascinated and couldn't put it down.  I must say that as much as I liked the heroine, Alison, she didn't seem fully drawn to me and there was something stereotypical, and less than fully human about her.  I think that is because while the author chides Nicholas for not appreciating the inner beauty of this flawed ordinary woman, he is still a bit like Nicholas himself, and while he feels he should be more appreciative of this \"real\" woman, he really isn't.  I could really relate to Alison's point of view that Nicholas was simply showing his superficiality in preferring the rich woman, but who knows, I guess the men have their point of view.  As far as I'm concerned this book portrays the mindset of the average male a lot better than \"He's just not that into you.\"	2005-09-28

However, Dr. Moon does not discuss non-Asians pretending to be Asian until one of the last chapters of the book.  This text really dealt with non-Chinese artistic responses to the Chinese and Chinese Americans and those two groups' counter response.  Most cultural studies focuses upon visual art or writings because any modern can read a book or use their eyes to analyze something.  However, and surprisingly, the focus in this book is on music.  Moon is knowledgeable about Chinese instruments and musical writing.  Music majors may be especially appreciative of this text. <br /> <br />This text must be a celebration of tenure, because I can't imagine a graduate student being able to pick up so much for a dissertation.  Further, this tenure is well-deserved:  it must have taken a lot to be a professor in Georgia and pull up so much historical evidence from San Francisco and New York City.  Sometimes the text is repetitive, but the reader can still notice that it took a lot of hard work to pull together and analyze all this material. <br /> <br />This book does not treat \"white\" and \"yellow\" exclusively; Native Americans, African-Americans, and even Eurasians are brought up.  Still, at one point Dr. Moon mentions a Black vaudevillian who take on the name Ding-a-Ling.  She totally fails to recognize the racialized phallocentricity here. <br /> <br />Dr. Moon is great at not seeing things as absolutes.  The time periods of the chapters overlap, as history actually doesn't have sharp beginnings and endings.  English Americans first dismiss Chinese music as \"noise\" but by comparing it to Scottish music, they recognize its musicality, at least somewhat.  Chinese music is seen as primitive by the white Americans mentioned here, yet they also use it to innovate or rejuvenate Western music.  Non-Chinese Americans deem the Chinese as perpetual foreigners, but Chinese Americans resist that label by mastering both Occidental and Oriental musical styles. <br /> <br />This book moves slowly, just like most history and academic books.  Still, it may be a great tool for ethnic studies majors and many other learners.	2005-09-28

Professor Bernstein has put the pieces together in a way that the general reader cannot but rethink their views on Capitalism.  It provides immense ammunition in the form of historical facts and logical arguments to support the premise that Capitalism is the system of freedom.  Bernstein documents the immense destruction and harm to human life and well-being caused by political systems that deny the primacy of individual rights, and brilliantly refutes the major Marxist criticisms of Capitalism that have evolved into modern myths.  By the time you finish the book, there is nothing left by which to support socialism over capitalism.   <br /> <br />Will those who are currently anti-capitalism or capitalist agnostics change their position?  For those open to reason, I don't see how the book cannot change the way they look at the world.  Bernstein's presentation of the philosophic and moral underpinnings of capitalism based on Ayn Rand's groundbreaking philosophical work is first rate, bringing to the fore the necessity of rational self-interest and individual rights for man to peacefully create wealth and prosper.  For those who are religiously anti-capitalistic due to an adherence to mysticism or nihilistic non-conformance to the requirements of civilization, there is no hope. <br /> <br />The mainstream culture may not like this book because it challenges the anti-capitalist mentality from the roots up on both philosophic and empirical grounds, but the challenge they will face is to refute it. <br /> <br />This book will stand as a classic.  It is another important arrow shot into the heart of the beast of statism in all its forms and a beacon for a renewed vision of the moral right of each person to live by their own mind in pursuit of their own interests with the right to be free from the initiation of force by others. <br />	2005-09-28

The story is based on photocopied documents (written by unknown persons) found in the Paris library.  The authors connect these documents with a group known as the Priori of Scion.  A supposed secret group that has been registered with the Paris authorities since the 1950s.  This group claims lineage with Jesus Christ himself.  Their documents are a story of his family's struggles through the years after the curcifiction against oppression from the Catholic Church.  Their family tree, opinions about biblical texts, and experiences with the church are well noted here as well as a conspiracy theory claiming Jesus was a flim flam artist. <br />    These documents reliablilty in supporting this claim is disqualified early on in the book.  The group, Priori of Scion has a huge grudge against the Catholic church.  Therefore anything they say is suspect.  Aparently, this group is related to the Merovingian tribe of peoples whose kindom existed during the end Roman Empire in what is now most of modern day Western Europe.  At some point their ancestors were all killed except one guy.  The Catholic church endorsed somebody else and ignored the \"rightful\" successor which basically screwed over that one guy.  In response, the Priori, through the years, has acted as a sort of pollitical activist group supporting Paganism and rejecting the church.  Therefore, bad feelings have been going back and forth between these 2 groups since the Spanish Inquisition up until today. <br />    The three authors coupled with factual information, the photocopied documents labeled secret, myths, folklore, and a critique of the gospels, lay a wopper of a conspiracy theory on us in a sensationalistic style compatible to that of a Hollywood movie.  The clear intention is to use shaking information, lots and lots of supposition, and shock value to sell a few books.  The story completely falls apart when you ask simple questions like why would somebody do this, why would the church care, etc.  They get you interested in the first few pages and then you realize what you're reading is about as factual as the Weekly World News in the check line of the super market.  For othrodoxed Christians wanting a good laugh, Gnostics wanting to read dirt on Jesus, or those mystified by an actual college research paper in real world circulation this book is for you.  But, if you're looking for a history of Jesus or something concrete this is fortune cookie history told by Bazooka Joe. <br />	2005-09-28

Scanning its pages, seeing the covers from the oldest Dungeons & Dragons books, I was instantly reminded of my priceless first days of gaming.   <br />      <br />The book has two interwoven sections: autobiographical sketches by either people from inside the RPG industry or else in the entertainment industry about their first exposure to the game, and segments about the history of Dungeons and Dragons and its supplements.  The history is like the DnD Special Edition DVD...fascinating background for anyone who has only ever seen TSR's finished products, but wants to know more about the process.  The self-sketches are for the most part well-written walks down nostalgia lane.  I found it extraordinarily inspiring to read about how DnD was such an important early creative experience for so many professional artists.   <br />      <br />While on the one hand I would have preferred a bit more substance (graphics cover much more of each page than text), I cannot deny the beauty of the layout, or that its highly graphic appeal are part of why I bought the book in the first place.   <br />      <br />Reading 30 Years of Adventure reminded me of a time when I wasn't afraid of humiliating myself by creating something less than a masterpiece.

Not surprisingly, her theoretical ethics comes up against real world situations where ethics have to be modified to suit the situation.  In the book, such things as older women marrying younger men is covered, along with a host of other ethical issues; which in isolation seem relatively easy to work out, but in combination with real life events, need a bit of adjusting. <br /> <br />Additionally interesting in this story is that his detective makes a huge error.  She in fact finds herself chasing her own ethical tail, as she goes off on a hunt for the completely wrong person.  The book makes it clear to readers, that things can go wrong; people can make false assumptions; assumptions that lead one to actions that are totally unjustified. <br /> <br />With wonderful command of the scene and setting, this book is one of McCall Smith's greatest creations.  It allows the reader to apply his/her own set of ethics to the various situations.  It allows the reader to attempt to figure out which ethical positions work for them, and what they would do in the same situation. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for all readers of McCall Smith.  It should not be passed up, as it is one of the most transitional and interesting books in his recent publications. <br />	2005-09-28

It's exactly the sort of book I put next to the toilet. <br /> <br />It turns out the book was somewhat funny, not very educational, and too easy of a read. <br /> <br />It was very shallow. Its answers to most of the questions had virtually no depth or detail in explanation. More often than not I finished a question highly disappointed; wanting to know more.  The authors barely skimmed the real answers, which is what I imagine people would buy the book for in the first place. <br /> <br />The party commentary was almost entertaining and served as a fairly decent segue into the chapters.  The IM narration, however, was total filler and went beyond useless. There are questions that the authors pose to each other that never actually get answered in the book. <br /> <br />This book doesn't deliver. I was highly let down by it. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a good book of \"off-beat\" questions, check out the Imponderables series by David Feldman.	2005-09-28

I got this book because I really wanted to read the advice on relationships and happiness from the Dalai Lama.  It does have a lot of good ideas on how to live happily and treat others with respect.  It's my first time reading a book \"by\" the Dalai Lama, and I'm impressed with the way he is portrayed as respectful of all people and all religions.  The quotations by the Dalai Lama are definitely inspiring and refreshing.  Unfortunately, the \"extra\" commentary by Mr. Cutler is very annoying.  Perhaps there are some who would be interested in all of the doubts and distractions Mr. Cutler describes (he is a psychiatrist, and regularly provides \"case studies\" throughout the book), but I was more interested in what the Dalai Lama had to say about the questions Cutler raises.  For my part, I would recommend this book as \"(diet) self-improvement,\" but it's not for someone who really wants to learn about Buddhist philosophy.	2005-09-27

It is certainly  a contender to stand as one of the best and most subtle of his interesting shelf of novels.<br /><br />Superficially concerning an aging American satyr at large on the Riveria, this book is really a searing black comedy worthy of Flaubert, a disturbing confession of certain unresolved and anarchic tendancies just below the surface of commonly shared American assumptions about personal liberty, personal space, and especially sex as both an entitlement and a reason for living in itself.  The book is also perfectly constructed and clever as high grade detective fiction, appearing to be one kind of book and then another, then perhaps another, always gripping and funny and sadly true, but holding back its deepest resonances until the very last paragraphs.<br /><br />Viertel has the advantages  of being one of the few writers personally schooled, both in the art of writing and the art of living, by Papa Hemingway, a story he has elsewhere told.  Some of his books, such as Love Lies Bleeding, are both conscious tribute and conscious counter-point to that mentoring.  For awhile in the reading, American Skin appears to be in the same vein -- a return to the turf of The Sun Also Rises, The Garden of Eden, and Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night -- only now late in the 20th century.  Yet finally, in the fullness of his years, Viertel comes fully into his own and looks over this territory as only an old man who has now lived longer than any of them could see it.  The plot's climactic unwinding packs the wallup of an old rogue bull escaped from the ring, full of menace and outrageous truth.  The reader is shocked by the simultaneity of feeling the pain of the protagonist's manly addiction, and at the same time objectively observing the appalling consequences of what he has allowed himself to connive at.  The text at this critical point has all the low key easy wit of silent comedy.  As Hemingway taught, the grandest and most difficult effects are only the simplest, and it takes a lifetime to learn that. This book is \"Exhibet A\" to that dictum.  American Skin is a negected and virtually unknown masterpiece of recent American literature.vely observing the appalling consequences of what he has allowed himself to connive at.

It's been eight years since some unknown force for some unknown reason decided to flip the switch on our lovely planet's ability to use most of its 20th Century technology (electricity, guns, etc.). In Dies the Fire we follow the people that the Change has affected in a pretty limited area, mostly Oregon and parts of Idaho, so to open half way across the world to see the Change in effect in England was a bit of a surprise. There, the change has had similar effects, causing mass chaos and death before a few enterprising soldiers helped the Royal Family escape, and later brought them back to reestablish order. And now, one of the key soldiers who helped pull the nation out of chaos is being rewarded by being imprisoned for dare suggesting that little things like Parliament be restored.    The more things change.    Thus starts The Protector's War. Nigel Loring, said soldier, is rescued and begins an exciting and adventure filled journey, past cannibals and pirates to a more familiar setting, Post Change's Williamette Valley. Meanwhile, in the Williamette, there hasn't been much of a change in the tensions between the harsh Overloard The Protector, and his rival heads of states, The Bear Killer's Mike Havel, and everyone's favorite Wiccan Clan Chieftain Juniper McKenzie. Yet, things haven't been totally static, families and communities have grown, and the lands overseen by our more malevolent leaders are thriving, through hard work and cooperation.    Yet, the tensions are still there and everyone knows a War is coming. Despite the title, the War isn't exactly imminent, but it's not exactly far in the future either. In the Bear Killer Camp, Lord Bear aka Mike Havel is becoming increasingly frustrated both on the home front and with the state of affairs. Despite increasing signs of aggression, many of Havel's allies are hesitant, while at home, it is becoming increasingly obvious to his wife, that young Rudi MacKenzie, Juniper's 9 year old son, is also the son of the Bear Killer chief.    The Mackenzies themselves are feeling the pressure of approaching war, while dealing with the Harvest. The Clan Chieftain is struggling with her ingrained distain for violence and warfare, despite it's necessity, and her knowledge that a proactive strike is needed. Yet, there are people suffering within the Protector's territory, and she uses this excuse as an opportunity to send a message, or more precisely, a bit of as slap in The Lord Protector's face.    What follows is a series of skirmishes between what is simply the forces of good, and the forces of evil. There is little in the ways of ambiguity here in Stirling's exciting and fast paced second novel in the series. The Protector is evil, plain and simple, and it doesn't take long for most people to realize that. Not even our English friend Nigel Loring, who coincidentally (although many character's in this book point out there are no such things as coincidences) ends up with a group inspecting the Protectorate for chemical weapons that were left behind after the change.    One of the ironies of the book is that, despite the title, The Protector and the upcoming war are minor characters in this book. In reality, like Dies the Fire, but on a different scale, this is about communities. The leaders of the opposing clans must find a way to bring order and stability within their community while preparing for a war with a potential stronger opponent. Basically, Mike and Juniper know that in order for them to have a chance in this war, they most get their own houses in order, and create something worth fighting for. Havel deals with the issues of family, while bringing the battle to a band of roving bandits being supported secretly by The Protector.    What impressed me most about this book was the way Stirling handled potential political issues within the framework of his story. Unlike some author's he never tries to exploit scenarios to make a political statement. It would be easy to turn this into a thinly disguised ficdtionalization of current events, but he never stoops to that level. Even the religious scenes of the Wicca religion, which dominate this book, are drawn with love, yet with enough of a skeptical voice to prevent this from becoming the Wiccan version of Left Behind.    The Protector's War suffers a bit from the second book syndrome. This is definitely a set up book, a bridge between two major events, the Change and the potential Williamette War between the aligned states and The Protector. The story lines at times seem a bit scattershot, but in the end they are all pulled together nicely. Including the British subplot, and giving us a small glimpse of the world beyond Orgegon, was a pleasant surprise, and a stroke of genius by the writer. In the end, this was a well written, fully detailed novel, full of developed character and a story that leave you wanting more. While not as complete or compelling as Dies the Fire, it is a good second step in the development of the story.	2005-09-27

The tone is engaging, however the book goes downhill when Allen uses dumb examples about Microsoft and Bill Gates which only reflect that he's got an immense amount of hatred for MS. I have no problem with Allen's feelings except for the fact that he encumbers the reader into separating the real topic from the hatred he exudes.

The crucial challenge of finding and developing talented actors is not overlooked either. Success for such a community production is measured by standards of artistic performance, community service, and management responsibility. Historical dramas are particularly appealing to community theater groups because of the wide freedom they allow in dealing with different historical times, the range of important and often colorful characters, and recurring issues in human affairs. Historical plays can also have a high education value for a local population when local historical characters, scenes, and topics are portrayed. All dimensions of this type of drama particularly suited to community theaters are dealt with, from developing an idea and perspective, writing a script, staging, and engaging with the larger community. This second edition is an abridged revision of the first edition put out in 1965.	2005-09-27

My husband and I had completely opposite views of the Harry Potter books, and just attempting to have a civilized discussion about them with him usually ended up with me getting a splitting headache.  Connie Neal's book provided us with a neutral arbiter that allowed us to talk about the subject peacefully.  She presents both sides of the \"Christian\" argument in a straight-forward, matter-of-fact way that while validating each side's right to its own opinion, challenges us to see the debate from the other point of view.<br /><br />Like it or not, Harry Potter has made a major cultural impact on our global society.  Christians can either choose to reject these works out of hand and miss a major witnessing opportunity, or we can choose to find parallels to the gospel story within the world of Harry Potter (and there are many!). Connie Neal shows us just how easy it is to present the Good News to neighbors who may never have read the Bible, but are completely familiar with JK Rowling's \"non-muggle\" world.  So, if you love these fantasy masterpieces, but feel that you have had to hide them from your friends and family, this book can help open up a fruitful dialogue that doesn't end in complete meltdown!	2005-09-27

The book details Fick's decision to join the Marine Corps while a Dartmouth undergraduate and his service in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. <br /> <br />In its scope, it is an important coming of age story and combat memoir and, as such, the book ranks with Seigfried Sassoon's Memoirs of an Infantry Officer, or E.B. Sledge's With the Old Breed.  As with those classic books, readers are immediately drawn into the story as Fick recounts life in the pre-9/11 Marine Corps, and the intensity and focus of life after the terror attacks on 9/11.  Through his account, the reader understands the spirit of the men and women who serve in our armed forces.  At times, this means a healthy suspicion of everything, great cynicism, and often gallows humor. <br /> <br />More significantly, Fick imparts to the reader a comprehension of life among Marines, where honor is not a concept but a way of life, as important to Marines as their weapons or ammunition.  His men and he are the best of their generation.  They possess a patriotism that is like a steel blade of the greatest strength:  cold, solid, and sharp-definitely not for show-whetted by professionalism in the art of killing and a strong sense of duty. <br /> <br />The book is equally well executed.  Fick writes with great skill, and so the reader has the acute sense of uncertainty about the objectives of the war, its horror in the conduct of the campaign, and elation at its end, as Fick recounts the events in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Reading the book, you can feel the sweat and dirt collecting on your skin, the haunting fear of chemical weapons, the camaraderie of men, the role chance plays in a warrior's life, and ultimately, how people react to the horrors of war as they happen and after the conflict ends. <br /> <br />The book should be read by those who want to understand military life, the training and life of Marines, leadership in combat, or for those who want an honest and direct appraisal of combat and the present situation in Iraq. <br />	2005-09-27

After being roundly criticized by the critics and by history itself, he has since then qualified his thesis.  He now believes that even though politically and economically we have reached the final destination, so to speak, science will continue to progress and pose new problems.<br /><br />\"Our Posthuman Future\" is divided into three parts: the first deals with the latest developments in biotechnology, the second part is a philosophical examination of what it means to be human, and the third part sets forth some policy recommendations for controling some of the potentially dangerous consequences of biotechnology.<br /><br />Fukuyama looks at the main areas of the biotech revolution that will have an enormous impact on life as we know it.  Neuropharmacologists have created drugs such as Prozac and Ritlin that are being used to control behavioural problems that in the past were solved by self-discipline and concentrated effort.  When human beings are using psychotropic drugs to correct or enhance their behaviours, they are missing out, according to Fukuyama, on critical experiences that make them human.<br /><br />Genetic engineering also poses some of the most complex and troublesome questions.  Gene alteration could prolong life, create \"designer babies,\" determine sex, physique, and IQ.  On the downside, genetic manipulation could \"embed one generation's social preferences,\" or it could increase inequality if only the rich could afford it.  Imagine a future in which there are rich countries with many people living well over a hundred and poor countries with exploding populations of people whose median age is in the twenties.  The potential for global instability becomes ever greater.<br /><br />The second part of the book centers on the philosophical problems of human nature and human rights.  Fukuyama argues that in order to oppose these dangerous developments we must return the universal notion of naturalism or natural rights.  Naturalism claims that there is an intrinsic universal human nature and that ethics, and therefore human rights can be derived from it.  Those opposing this view call it the naturalistic fallacy.  (Hume said that we cannot derive an \"ought\" from an \"is.\")  Opponents claim that human nature can only be expressed in the context of historically contingent societies.  This is the old nature vs nurture debate, and Fukuyama falls squarely on the side of nature.  If nurture or culture is the defining aspect of human nature then biothech expands unfettered.  Fukuyama claims that human nature is a universal essence - which he conveniently fails to define - from which it is possible not only to understand human dignity, but also to develop a doctrine of human rights.<br /><br />But how does one defend human nature if it is malleable and alterable?  Science has its own imperatives, business has its own imperatives, and the consumer has his or her own imperatives.  Biotechnology will continue to advance and a static notion of human nature will continue to be tested.<br /><br />In the final part of the book, Fukuyama recommends a governmental regulatory board that on the one hand must ensure the advancement of science and on the other hand must preserve human dignity.  Societies that are on the verge of a posthuman future need to start debating more seriously what will be allowed and what will be forbidden.  A microcosm of this debate would be the debate on abortion, one side arguing the fetus' right to life and the other side the right of the mother to control her own body.  The debate on future biotech issues will no doubt be equally acrimonious and divisive.  I highly recommend this book as a primer for this debate.part of the book centers on the philosophical problems of human nature and human rights.

Hinton staple books (\"That Was Then, This is Now\" - \"Tex\" - and \"Rumble Fish\") repeatably as a teenager.  Even then they were dated in literal context (i.e. gangs are between caucasian upper and lower class in this book), but they still captured the angsty spirit of being a teen and the changes that result from growing up.  It also captured the brutility that jealousy can engender as well as cause and effect.  Unfortunately, as usual, Hinton also falls back on her parentless boys raising themselves, creating their own sense of 'family' plot-point.  I don't know why her four books hinge on this, but it would be interesting to see the other side of this coin.<br /><br />As it is, the protagonist, Ponyboy, has written his story as a make up essay for a class.  Within it is the struggle of somebody who has both the capacity and drive to lift himself from his poor, gang-life background, but is full of uncertainty whether he can or should.  His friends and siblings are all fully realized characters, flawed, but still endearing for the most part.  Even they recognize the differences in Ponyboy and in their own ways as surrogate older brothers, support him.  Again, as usual, with Hinton, it takes a series of tragedies to force the conclusion of this book.<br /><br />I bought this for my son, though at nearly twelve, I'll likely wait a bit to give it to him.  Living as he does in an era where gangs are an invasive part of city life, regardless of whether you belong to one or not, I believe it would be good for him to understand the various reasons one might join a gang, as well as experience a point of view of those who have not had as fortunate an upringing as his own.	2005-09-26

It had been a while since I'd read any Nora Roberts books. I usually stick to her trilogies, feeling like those usually deliver more of what I've come to expext from her.<br /><br />The first story, Night Shield, is about Detective Allison Fletcher and former bad boy Jonah Blackhawk. Allison comes from a family dedicated to upholding the law, while Jonah has had a past steeped in breaking it. Both are distrustful of one another even though they must work together to catch thieves that have been targeting customers at Jonah's clubs. Neither wants to give into the obvious attraction that sparks between them, but are helpless to avoid it. I have to admit that Jonah drove me crazy in this story at times. He had the biggest trust issue of the two, and I just wanted to hit him at times. Maybe this is good thing? Possibly, if it makes the reader feel something for the characters, no if it just makes you want to turn the pages to get to something better.<br /><br />Night Moves was by far the better story. It deals with many stereotypes we encounter in everyday life: Celebrity impressions, small town prejudices, general assumptions about people that usually just don't hold true in real light. Maggie Fitzgerald is a grammy award winning movie score composer that has had it with the high-flying intense action of Hollywood. She's ready for a change and buys an old home and some land in a small rural community, far removed from the hustle and bustle of her busy life...or so she hopes. What she doesn't plan for is Cliff Delaney, landscaper extraordinaire, the feelings he stirs in her, or what he finds in her front yard. I wanted to ring Cliff a new one a few times for not wanting to give Maggie a chance to prove herself. Most of the time he just assumes she is a spoiled rich girl, but he comes around by the end. Maggie turns out to be more than he bargained for and is more than able to prove herself to him. This story makes you stop and think about how we tend to judge people without truly knowing them first.<br /><br />Overall, a great book to curl up with on a quiet night. My only complaint is that I wish Roberts had fleshed out her characters a little more. It seems to me that she tends to create characters that are too \"tidy\". Yes, they get angry, yes, they feel passion, but it all seems like it's contained in a nice neat box. When Roberts describes their feelings, it's as if there is a line that's never crossed. I wish she would let her characters cross that line more often.y the end. Maggie turns out to be more than he bargained for and is more than able to prove herself to him.

This is a continuation of THE CELESTINE PROPHECY and THE TENTH INSIGHT.  This volume leads us on a journey in search of the 11th Insight.  He finds Shangri-La near Tibet and learns valuable lessons to help him to further evolve in his mission.  Paul Theroux took some of us along vicariously as he documented his trip from China to Lhasa, formerly the home of the Dahlai Lama.  Lowell Thomas was allowed to broadcast from Kathmandu in the Himalayas.    So this trip by James Redfield is familiar to those of us who were fans of Thomas and Theroux in the past.  When I reviewed his first #1 bestseller to a small group of literary women, a newcomer from California asked, \"Are those your words?\"  I had to admit that they came out of the book (his words) but I had (to make more sense of them) to skip around in the book to put them in order of the insights, which were interwoven in this treasure hunt fable.  She was impressed that a Southern woman could do that.  My son was not impressed; he said they were standard Eastern doctrines.  Redfield was then a resident of Alabama.  He's moved around a bit since he won fame for his three motivating adventures about Celestine beliefs and insights.    In THE TENTH INSIGHT,  he gave the history and culture which he found in the Appalachians.  \"Our thoughts and attitudes count in making our dreams come true.\"  This book is intended as the next step in awareness to help realize our destinies and purpose in life.  \"The Eastern religions emphasized the effects on consciousness itself, the experience of lightness, a sense of oneness with the univrese, the release of the ego's desires, and a certain detachment.  Islam emphasized the feeling of unity which came with sharing this experience with others and the power inherent in group action.\"    Judaism emphasized the importance of tradition based on this connection, of the experience of being chosen, and that each person alive is responsible for pushing forward the evolutin of human spirituality.  \"Most people are full of energy and enthusiasm in their youth, but then during middle age they lapse into a slow, downhill slide that they pretend not to notice.\"    The WWII generation fought against tyranny and proved that democracy could not only flourish in the modern world but expand and connect the world's economies.  Then, in the middle of the abundance, \"the baby boomers arrived to say that there  were problems with this expansion, that we were polluting the natural would and losing touch with nature and a spiritual reality which exists beneath the whims of history.\"    Where will he find the twelfth?	2005-09-26

US	31836277	R1Z0Z0YI0TRIP0	0199247110	583682773	Memories of a Lost War: American Poetic Responses to the Vietnam War (Oxford English Monographs)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Stateside Poetry versus Veteran Poetry in Memories of a Lost War	Subarno Chattarji introduces his book with historical and political information about the rising struggles within Vietnam and the United States that ultimately lead to war, briefly introducing American fears of the domino theory, where one Southeastern Asian country falling to communism would result in the rest following suit.  Chattarji quickly divides the poetry of the Vietnam War era into three categories: stateside poetry, which largely focuses on the anti-war movement, and veteran (or soldier) poetry, and Vietnamese poetry.  Chattarji&#8217;s division focuses mainly on the stateside poetry and veteran poetry, and, by clearly demarcating the strict line that separates the two, he upholds the division that veteran poets such as W.D. Ehrhart regard as essential: &#8220;&#8216;The few poems I read about Vietnam after I came back only made me angry: What the hell did these people know about it, for chrissake?&#8217;&#8221; (92). Chattarji furthers his divisions by dividing veteran poetry into three categories: protest and anguish, combat experience, and the aftermath, with each chapter highlighting poetry representative of the chapter&#8217;s title.  The final chapter, dealing with Vietnamese poetry translated into English, is Chattarji&#8217;s attempt to represent all different sides of the Vietnam War: American soldiers and protestors and Vietnamese soldiers and civilians, though Chattarji cannot directly correlate Vietnamese poetry to traditional western poetic influences evident in stateside and veteran poetry.  Chattarji emphasizes American soldier poetry, establishing it as the crux of the book, but also introduces a hint of resentment by soldier poets against stateside poetry figureheads such as Ginsberg, Levertov, and Bly.  Carefully straddling the fence on whether one holds more impact over the other, Chattarji introduces and juxtaposes the ever-changing stances of Erhart, a prominent soldier poet of the Vietnam war, on the stateside poets: &#8220;Althoughthe essay [of Erhart&#8217;s] does stress the problems with stateside poetry, it is largely an endorsement of protest poetry in times of crisis such as the one represented by Vietnam&#8221; (93) and &#8220;[Erhart] stated that poetry by Bly, Levertov, Ginsberg, and others, had &#8216;served a political purpose,&#8217; but it &#8216;doesn&#8217;t work&#8217; as poetry and is &#8216;not durable&#8217;&#8221; (93).  Therefore with the line established between veteran poetry and stateside poetry, Chattarji draws a connection between the two (i.e. the poetry that both sub-genres draw from) and uses the poetic background and influences of each to found the principal that the two&#8212;though in opposition&#8212;work toward a similar poetic expression, or goal, that uniquely identifies the horrors of the Vietnam War in order to prevent their reoccurrence in future wars. <br />  <br />Chattarji avoids associating stateside poetry, and its traditional anti-military sentiment, with the awe-inspiring images of the terror of first-hand experience associated with veteran poetry, but he links the two by drawing their poetic roots and foundations to earlier American/British wars (i.e. World War I and II) and poets such as Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, Howard Nemerov, and Randall Jarrell.  By tying the two somewhat opposing types of poetry together, specifically emphasizing the rich poetic background from which anti-war and soldier poets draw, Chattarji extends his idea that, &#8220;American poetry on Vietnam does not exist in a critical, literary vacuum&#8221; (25).  Chattarji clearly establishes Bly, Levertov, Ginsberg, and Nemerov as strong stateside poets during the Vietnam War.  Chattarji opens his chapter on stateside poetry by introducing several of Nemerov&#8217;s poems about World War II, which actually provide connections to his later poems: &#8220;The connections are interesting and evident, particularly the ways in which Nemerov highlights the instrumentalist natureof state language in his poems on Vietnam&#8221; (31).  Nemerov, whose main work is emblematic of the combat he experienced in World War II, also writes about the Vietnam War, drawing specifically from influential poets such as William Butler Yeats.  Chattarji introduces Nemerov&#8217;s poem, &#8220;On Being Asked for a Peace Poem,&#8221; and then quickly points to the title&#8217;s allusion to Yeats&#8217;s poem, &#8220;On Being Asked for a War Poem.&#8221;  Nemerov uses the title to depict the social advancement from a focus on war to a focus on peace, borrowing from Yeats and expanding his own poem into, &#8220;a less terse, more complex and humorous insight into the relationship between a poet and war&#8221; (70).  Nemerov is the only major stateside poet, who had actually experienced combat, which Chattarji addresses in his chapter on stateside poetry.  Chattarji uses Nemerov as a transitional figure between soldier poets and stateside (or anti-war) poets.  Chattarji shifts focus from Nemerov to other stateside poets whose poetry is clearly based on a political agenda such as Bly&#8217;s poem in his book The Teeth Mother Naked at Last: <br />  <br />This is what it&#8217;s like for a rich country to make war <br /> this is what it&#8217;s like to bomb huts (afterwards described            as &#8216;structures&#8217;) <br />      this is what it&#8217;s like to kill marginal farmers (afterwards <br />  described as &#8216;Communists&#8217;). (53) <br /> <br />Chattarji points out that, &#8220;The agenda is not one of unearthing &#8216;true&#8217; or &#8216;authentic&#8217; information, it is one of highlighting the proliferation of the war, and the polyphony of that spread.  The poem counterpoints brutal destruction with clinical military jargon&#8221; (53).  Bly&#8217;s poetic enjambments and his mingling of &#8220;military jargon&#8221; combined with overarching statements of destruction prove his poetic talents, but his poem strays in effectiveness because of the lack of gruesome details prevalent in soldier poetry.  Chattarji defends Bly&#8217;s poem by stressing that the poem&#8217;s agenda is different from the traditional authenticity of soldier poetry, but W.D. Ehrhart&#8217;s statement that the political poetry &#8220;doesn&#8217;t work&#8221; rings true when comparing Bly&#8217;s poem to the vivid images, smells; sounds of soldier poetry.  Erhart&#8217;s statement that the political poetry is &#8220;not durable&#8221; is clearly evident from post-war perspective of over thirty years.  Bly&#8217;s poetry, like most stateside political poetry, clearly loses its impact when taken out of the time period in which it was written, whereas soldier poetry, with its grisly portrayals of atrocities, stands out past its historical context, actually gaining popularity as the years of the war sink further into the past.   <br />  <br />Chattarji introduces the same poetic influences in soldier poetry as in stateside poetry early in the first section of veteran poetry with a quote from W.D. Ehrhart: &#8220;The main thing that happened in the early writing when I was trying to figure out how to write about the Vietnam War, was the influence of other writers I read&#8212;some of Sassoon, but everything of Owen&#8230;I knew his work very well&#8230;so when I began to write about my war, that was my reference point&#8230;So, early on, you find me completely missing all the rich imagery of my own war and, instead, inserting images about blood dripping like tears from the blade of a bayonet&#8221; (113).  Chattarji even goes as far as comparing the trenches at Khe Sanh to the stalemated trench warfare of World War I, but he emphasizes that, despite the loose historical correlation between the trenches, the early images in the poetry of the Vietnam War come directly from the soldier poets like Owen and Sassoon of World War I&#8212;images borrowed to express the horrors of a new war until soldier poets of the Vietnam War could find their &#8220;own language&#8221; (113) and &#8220;come to grips with the peculiar reality of Vietnam&#8221; (113).  Chattarji&#8217;s first chapter on veteran poetry mainly deals with protest and anguish, though he includes some immature poetry in support of the war, and Chattarji accentuates his emphasis on protest and anguish by pointing out the soldier poet&#8217;s early inability to create a unique images of the Vietnam war, simply relying on and borrowing poetic devises popularized by earlier poets. <br />  <br />In Chattarji&#8217;s second chapter of veteran poetry, he underlines combat experiences, where the soldier poets have found their unique poetic voices and expressions, often dealing with internal struggles of morality and ethics and the basic human struggle to stay alive.   The first poem Chattarji introduces in this section is David Connolly&#8217;s &#8220;After the Firefight,&#8221; where Connolly clearly uses images unique to the Vietnam War and also deals with the soldier&#8217;s ability or inability to deal with the horrors of a new kind of warfare: <br /> <br /> Afterwards, with the gunfire <br /> still ringing loudly in our ears, <br /> but not so loudly <br /> that it drowned out the screams. <br /> And afterwards, <br /> still blinded by the tracers&#8217; flashes, <br /> but not blinded enough <br /> by the pumping or sucking or gaping wounds; <br /> we&#8217;d come to our sense, <br /> what sense were left. <br /> When the rush of adrenaline, <br /> and the haste to stop the life <br /> from spilling out of a Brother, <br /> and the hesitancy to touch <br /> what was human, <br /> was over, <br /> we&#8217;d strut and brag and bluster <br /> for each other. <br /> Later, we would weep, <br /> separately, <br /> for the little <br /> that was left of us. <br /> Much later <br /> we would weep together, <br /> when it appeared <br /> there would be nothing left. (122) <br /> <br />Chattarji addresses the poem&#8217;s message that the struggle doesn&#8217;t end once the fighting is over:  &#8220;At the end of the battle there is &#8216;nothing left&#8217; except the awareness that one has lost everything; the long, lonely nightmare of life after war has just begun&#8221; (123).  Connolly&#8217;s poem deals with the American soldier&#8217;s outward expression of pride in being a good soldier: &#8220;we&#8217;d strut and brag and bluster / for each other.&#8221;  Here Connolly expresses the immediate relief after battle, set off with the comic relief of bragging between soldiers, but Connolly furthers the poem by expressing the idea that bragging was a means by which the soldiers could delay their expressions of sorrow&#8212;&#8220;Later, we would weep.&#8221;  Connolly&#8217;s poem, in comparison to the earlier poem by Bly, maintains a multi-faceted message with deep-seated undertones of grief felt by the surviving soldiers.  Poetically, Connolly&#8217;s poem stands up to (and outweighs in my opinion) Bly&#8217;s poem.  Connolly develops rich lingual texture within his lines such as the alliteration and repetition of the &#8216;w&#8217; sound in &#8220;we would weep.&#8221;  Connolly also uses enjambment (or line-breaks) to emphasize and tweak out ambiguities and alternate meanings; specifically, Connolly breaks line 12 at the word &#8220;life&#8221; so that the line reads &#8220;and the haste to stop the life,&#8221; which hints at killing, but Connolly extends his enjambment to actually discuss the preservation of life in line 13: &#8220;from spilling out of a Brother[.]&#8221;  The veteran poetry clearly touches on ideas, fears, realities, and grieves that the stateside poetry lacks, which again echoes Ehrhart&#8217;s statement that political poems are &#8220;not durable.&#8221;   <br />  <br />Chattarji&#8217;s final chapter on veteran poetry deals with the aftermath of the war and the struggle of the American soldier to return to civilian life after encountering the horrors and atrocities of Vietnam.  Horace Coleman&#8217;s poem &#8220;D-Day + 50; Tet + 25&#8221; deals with the soldier&#8217;s struggle as a survivor of war: <br /> <br />  It&#8217;s been all my life since Normandy <br /> and half my life since Tet. <br /> And the scars my father and I <br /> share in our minds are half-healed. <br /> The shock of survival can be <br /> worse than other wounds. <br /> We didn&#8217;t know there would be <br /> seams on our souls. (145). <br /> <br />In his analysis of Coleman&#8217;s poem, Chattarji focuses on the connection the speaker of Coleman&#8217;s poem makes to his father who &#8220;fought the &#8216;good war&#8217;&#8221; (145).  Coleman&#8217;s poem clearly creates an irony by juxtaposing the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the Tet Offensive in Vietnam because American forces took the offensive on D-Day, whereas the Tet Offensive was a Viet Cong attack, where American forces fought a defensive battle across all sectors of Vietnam.  The irony in Coleman&#8217;s poem serves as a vehicle to compare the aftermath of battle and the struggles of surviving in both Vietnam veterans and veterans of the &#8216;good war&#8217;&#8212;World War II.  Coleman&#8217;s poem, like much of the poetry Chattarji explores in his aftermath chapter of veteran poetry, embodies the efforts of veterans to effectively deal with the trauma they experienced in war, clearly outweighing the political agendas of the stateside poetry by focusing on the individual instead of the country, the soldier instead of the military.   <br />  <br />The stateside poetry and veteran poetry which Chattarji outlines as opposing agendas, styles, and effectiveness serves to create a literary movement containing rough and fervent images of the effects of warfare technology on the individual.  Stylistically, much of the early soldier poetry does match the poetic quality of the stateside poetry, but, as more soldiers returned from Vietnam, they found their voices and turned to poetry as an arguably therapeutic means to cope and deal with their own demons, providing a rich, unique poetic texture that strongly outweighs the political agendas of many of the stateside poets.  Chattarji&#8217;s final chapter addresses the translated poetry of Vietnamese citizens, which draws from a different poetic background, largely emphasizing pastoral ideals and mixing them with language of the war, specifically images of bombings in Chattarji&#8217;s book.  With different poetic backgrounds, the poetry of the Vietnamese people is largely incomparable to stateside and veteran poetry, simply because of the lingual and literary differences.  Chattarji&#8217;s book carefully explores the poetic foundations of the poetry of the Vietnam War, pitting soldier poets, struggling to find a voice, against established, professional poets, who focus (inappropriately) on the political context of the Vietnam War instead of dealing with the psychological elements and the rude, narrow images staining America&#8217;s supposed moral and ethical superiority.  Chattarji appropriately focuses the bulk of his book on the veteran poetry that came out of the Vietnam War, providing insight to the anguish and horrors expressed in the unabashedly crude poetry of the America&#8217;s crude war. <br />	2005-09-26

This book is well organized, methodically studying each possible opening-overcall situation and looking at the alternatives to a double and the proper responses to a double in each situation. Marty's numerous examples make his ideas clear. <br /> <br />This book misses my 5th star for two major reasons: (1) a method of bidding over a negative double by the overcalling side would be welcome, and (2) the book does not address the alternative \"negative free bid\" approach (although this may be beyond the scope of this book). However, it's good to see the scientist in Marty (if you've only read \"Points Schmoints\" and \"Marty Sez\", check out the \"Better Bidding with Bergen\" series!) return in the Thrump Double concept! <br /> <br />Novice to advanced players will benefit from this book, and even experts will find some meat here.	2005-09-26

I've never played the actual 40K game but didn't feel confused by any aspect of this book.  In fact, this book did a lot to bring the situation in the 40K universe into sharper focus.  By telling the story from the perspective of Eisenhorn, Abnett is able to portray the Inquisitor's true feelings and gives the whole story a very personal feel.  It must have been harder to write the book in the first person, but I think it enhances the power of the story.<br /><br />As in other Warhammer books, this one is non-stop, page-turning action.  While sometimes predictable, this book is in no way boring.  All of the characters are great and the plot is intense.  The dark vision of the 40K universe is compelling and unique.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the rest of the series.	2005-09-26

The important part of this book was attempting to gain insight into the people, the characters, of this little known story.  Not only did this book give me a sense of what life and work in a Nazi government was like, but what it was like to be in Tibet in the early 20th century.  It depicted the members of the expedition not as 'Nazis' and thus 'evil, bad and terrible beasts' but as breathing beings who experienced this one particular (and peculiar) event.   <br />Now I've romanticized it a bit and it is a shame that Mr. Schafer and others' interior motives could not possibly be touched in this book but Mr. Hale does an adequate job of attempting to recreate his persona through the writings and observations of others.	2005-09-26

This book has nothing useful to say about special forces.  Its a book for armchair guys who dream about playing army man. <br /> <br />I've heard most of what he has to say about special forces before.  But I heard it 40 years ago.  Those people I can respect because they didn't have the lessons to draw on that we do today.  But Kaplan seems to have forgotten everything thats been learned at a very high cost over decades and wants to do it all over again.  The biggest lesson is that special forces can't win wars on their own and they can't be scaled up in size without losing all of their value. <br /> <br />The first thing he gets wrong is that special forces have limits and they depend on the rest of the military to support them.  The reason why special forces are useful is because they are (mostly) a hand-picked elite.  The bigger you expand these forces, the more you lose the quality that made them valuable in the first place.  People also have to realize that a special forces guy with a radio isn't winning the war on his own.  He is depending on a complex set of air force and navy (carrier-based) infrastructure to support him in the field.  These ops may be one guy on the ground, but it takes a whole lot of guys behind the scenes to support him.  Kaplan doesn't understand that.  He ignores all of those people and the job they are doing.  He seems to want to spend more time being one of the guys than understanding the real military. <br /> <br />He gives a one-sided really confused history of special forces and what he thinks is the strength of the marines.  His history of the special forces ignores all the hard lessons learned in places like Vietnam about what works and what doesn't.  Reading Kaplan, you would think the whole evolution of these forces and the methods for using them never happened.   <br /> <br />Another thing about this book I really don't like is how Kaplan pretends like he understands soldiers or that he is having the same experience they are.  He isn't.  You are either in the military or you are not.  He is a guest and a spectator, not a participant.  He isn't even really brave as a reporter.  The brave reporters in places like Iraq are not the ones who travel with the military, its the guys who go out on their own to cover the story of the country without being surrounded by soldiers.  Some of the guys who have done that have died.  Compared to a guy like Steve Vincent, Kaplan is a REMF. <br /> <br />It gets worse because he starts to over-identify with soliders part way through the book.  But the over-idenitification has more to do with his politics that the reality of military life.  Kaplan starts spitting out hate.  Hate for politicians, hate for officers, hate for the pentagon, hate for reporters, hate for elites.  He leaves the impression that america would be better off if we destroyed washington and put a bunch of junior officers in charge of the country.   <br /> <br />Thats another problem.  Kaplan, among other things, is immature.  Military Officers are not superhumans and they have the same flaws as people that civilians in America do.  Kaplan reduces the military to \"fun and games\" out on what he calls the frontier.  But its not a game.  The people who might have told Kaplan that are the people he either didn't listen to in this book or dismissed as cowards and fools.  Junior Officers don't know everything and they make mistakes.  They learn hard lessons on the job. <br /> <br />Kaplan's political views are worse.  He sees the entire Muslim world as enemy territory that the US needs to conquer and civilize as we did the old west.  He wants the reader to see our bases in Iraq as a new generation of fort apaches and places like Iran and Syria as Indian Reservations.  He sees special forces as the way to do this.  <br /> <br />Kaplan also supportsin the book a new manifest destiny for an american empire, not based on security, but based on the moral mission of America to rule and civilize the world.  He as much as says that 9/11 was a brilliant excuse for a whole other agenda of using the american military to build empire.  He is almost proud of it!  None of it will ever work.   <br /> <br />For anyone who wants to understand the military, don't read books like this.  Read books from people who really served.  Kaplan doesn't understand anything about the military.  There are shelves of books and reports from the vietnam that will tell anyone all they would ever need to know about the strengths and limitations of the special forces. <br />	2005-09-26

I think that Jennifer Weiner knows her audience well and writes stories that have a simple and crisp narration.  Her books are enjoyable and serve a purpose in literature.  The narrator (Cannie, Kate...) are always fairly likable people with amusing situations.  Quite a number of times I find myself laughing out loud to her books and the situations that the characters find themselves in.  <br /> <br />The downside:  Chick lit doesn't mean cliche. Jennifer Weiner is obviously a talented writer (you try writing a book) but she sometimes reverts to the same tired phrases over and over again. (smooths her pants...etc...you'll get the picture). It just seems that she's above all that.  Also, the dumped upon overweight girl that Kate is characterized as is sort of old hat by now. Cannie was interesting b/c she was overweight but she exerised, etc. The heroine's weight defining her existence is a bit stale.  Also, Weiner is not striving to be Falkner, but maybe just a little bit more detail.  <br /> <br />Overrall...I liked the book. I like her style. I just want maybe something a little fresher for the next novel.  I'd recommend her books.  It's easy to see why she is so successful. Her stories are simple, edited well and the message is driven home.  Good for her.	2005-09-26

This book has it all - erudition, polemics, irreverence,  controversy, intrigue, irony, eroticism, romance, depravity... the list is endless!  Meticulously researched and annotated, soundly argued and reasoned, Mr. Robb is a gracious champion to the very complex artist who is historically reduced to a one-dimensional churl who happened to have a way with a paint-brush.  <br /> <br />Caravaggio was a pioneer (a very dangerous occupation during the counter-reformation),  -   the manner in which he approached his subjects, the lighting (or relative lack there-of), his refusal to sketch out a work before painting it, his perspective, his \"earthy\" handling of religious themes;  these approaches became both his claim to fame, and his downfall.  A downfall facilitated by jealous contemporaries, greedy art collectors, and Caravaggio's own sexual and social indiscretions.  <br /> <br />Not a light read by any means - make sure your thinking cap is well positioned, and your seat belt is tightly fashioned - you're in for one hell of a ride! <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-09-26

How could he ever, ever explain  all the weird and wonderful creatures introduced in Ilium? Answer - he can't, so he doesn't. Not really.<br /><br />The explanations for the Voynix, Setebos, Propero and many others were dissapointing if not silly. Still other pieces go completely unexplained. I even found a continuity error in the mix.<br /><br />I still love the author's style, but too much is contrived and unexplained. I am not talking the kind of explantion that insults the reader to include. None of these things could be reasoned out.<br /><br />Anyway, despite these things, Dan Simmons has given us Hyperion, and he's given us Ilium, two great sci-fi novels. So, I will continue to read anything that he produces. However, I'm not holding out for the perfect ending.	2005-09-26

If a reader is watching for lowfat recipes, the numbers given would be misleading. <br />For example, the apple walnut salad is said to serve 6 people with each serving containing 4.6 grams of fat.  However, with 66 to 70 grams of fat in the entire recipe, the fat grams per serving would be 10 to 11 grams.  Quite a difference!  <br />Also, the chicken & grapefruit stir fry would have at least 6 grams of fat per serving rather than the 3 grams stated in the book.  This problem would be significant for those with heart or coronary artery disease who are attempting to follow a very lowfat diet.

Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired, the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds, characters, and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions, and thus events, for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys, or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example, a strange jester/clown character, Magnifico, that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction.	2005-09-26

I will try to comment only on its presentation. <br /> <br />The Tibetan fixation of Himmler's was one of many outgrowths of his general occult/mystical obsession, and in the sense that in this case a project was actually begun and brought to successful completion, this is a story that merits telling.  The five main Germans on the expedition were all pretty accomplished and competent people, and some real research was done.  Much of it was useless or based on totally flawed assumptions, but hey, is that any different from any government program authorized with somebody else's money today? <br /> <br />Hale has a very good grasp, for a westerner, of the intricacies of Tibetan politics at this period in history, and is knowledgeable enough about the geopolitics involved and the Great Game implications as well.  He also knows, or has presented parts of what others know, about the ideological/mystical \"ideas\" behind Himmler's interest in Tibet, as well as the scientific aspects behind anthropological and scientific work of this kind done in the early 20th century.  This material makes for interesting and fresh, informative reading, at least when the sources used are credible (alas, they aren't always). <br /> <br />But he tries to do too much.  He wants to tell us about the adventures of the expeditions, the flora and fauna killed and/or photographed, the politics behind the actions of the Chinese, Germans, British (incl. Indian), Tibetans, Sikkimese, Nepalese, and not omitting various warlords, the march of events in Europe, the personal backgrounds of every single major and minor character, all of this in exhaustive detail; he tends to go into improbably precise descriptions of individual conversations in a \"you are there\" kind of way, describing characters' thoughts as they sipped their morning tea, at their English breakfasts, etc etc et multiple cetera; and of course he waxes descriptive over the obviously phenomenal landscapes involved, not only the sights and sounds but also (especially in the case of certain towns) the smells and feels.  It's all too much, and the book tends to go on and on. <br /> <br />There is also a lot written about relationships we have no way of knowing anything about, between Schaefer and Kaiser, e.g., where the English characters read one motivation into it - just guess - and the Germans another.  We do not know what Hale thinks.  That's because no one alive knows what actually happened.  It should likely have been left alone. <br /> <br />Finally, there is, throughout much of the book, a lot of heavy breathing where Hale is apparently trying to make it clear to the reader (or the reviewers?) that the Nazis and their motivations are loathesome, hateful, criminal, and so on.  No kidding.  But after hundreds of pages of this stuff, it almost comes across as too much of a muchness.  Today it is 2005, and one hopes that every reader of this type of material knows by now that Himmler was a very very bad man, serving a very very evil regime, and that the people in his various organizations all have at least a little blood on their hands, and a lot of splainin to do.  A little bit less of the obvious and the book would read quicker.	2005-09-25

The facts he brings to light compel to reread our contemporary history : Germany was about to use the atomic bomb, but time was running out. Sailing to Japan with its precious cargo, the U-Boat U-234 was intercepted - an event of incalculable consequences. <br /> <br />Hydrick was apparently the first researcher to peer into the indisputable data on the daily production of enriched uranium at Oak Ridge, on the actual quantities shipped to Los Alamos, as well as on the actual assembling of the first atomic bombs. His conclusion : without these 560 kg of U235 (a critical mass was about 50), the United States could not have made it by mid-August.  <br /> <br />Obviously the result of years of painstaking research, reading and thinking, the book boasts a clear, factual, coherent writing, without a trace of sensationalism. On the publisher's site, whitehurstcompany.com, the prospective reader will find very positive comments by specialists. Dr. Delmar Bergen, who directed the Weapons Program Office at Los Alamos, writes that \"The facts (...) certainly lead the experienced physicist to believe the [seized] material was enriched uranium\". D. Ray Smith, Oak Ridge historian, even wrote that \"Critical Mass is a defining work that every earnest researcher of the Manhattan Project and World War Two should own, and that should be in every library.\"  <br /> <br />The Manhattan Project is considered the greatest scientific and technological accomplishment of American history. But the terrifying weapons were finally used ; it has been repeated that this absolute violence had been necessary to end the war. But we know that Tokyo had been trying to negociate, and that the bombs had been meant as a warning to Russia. A carnage gave this nation its empire on the world - thanks to Nazi Germany.	2005-09-25

I strongly disagree with the above review.  The reviewer's experience may be a lesson to parents to skim a gift book themselves, before reading it to a child.  <br />  <br />Sometimes a popular writer, who usually writes \"fluffy\" books will feel strongly enough about a social issue that they write a more serious book.  Robert Munsch co-wrote a book about a young girl refuge from war-torn Lebanan who was terrified by Halloween, because it reminded her of the guns and death in her home country.  It is scary enough that I keep it in our school library's LIFE ISSUES section (which includes puberty, death, divorce, family problems, disabilities, and war). Older children and parents can find these books when they need them. <br /> <br />Eve Bunting has also written books that are just \"fun\" (like Sunflower House, or Mother's Day Mice) but she has also written about the Vietnam Veterans'Wall, the Watts riots (Smoky Night),and about homeless people (December). <br /> <br />Before I became a Librarian 13 years ago, I was a social worker for 20 years, and worked with battered women and their children, and with abused children.  Sometimes a book is helpful to an adult or a child, to see that they are not the only ones in this situation.  That is why I do have the book \"Squabbles\" in our library, in case a family needs it, to facilitate talking about the problem. <br /> <br />My only concern about the book is that it shows the father back with his family, after learning how to handle his anger.  That is not possible for a lot of families, in which the abuser may not be willing to change, and the mother must make a new start as a single parent.  However, on the good side, the book shows the rabbit father taking strong action to protect the raccoon wife and child, showing community support for the victims. <br /> <br />As for the \"lying\" about the bruises, victims of violence often do so, not because they don't care about telling the truth, but because they have learned to hide and cover up the violence, so they will not make the abuser angry, and get beaten for \"telling\" on the abuser. It is a survival skill, needed until they are safe.	2005-09-25

However, I believe he misdiagnoses the problem of destructive faith as merely one of traditional religions. He is correct that certain writings and doctrines of traditional religions, if taken literally, and without regard for common moral intuitions, can lead to extreme anti-human actions. In an era where it is easy to get access to destructive weapons, this can be extremely dangerous to a decent world civilization. But the most destructive ideologies of the last 100 years have been those of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. None of these ideologies is based on a belief in God. Harris briefly describes Stalinism and Maoism as constituting \"a political religion\" and claims that the Nazis were \"agents of religion\" (p. 79 of the book). This is using the term \"religion\" in an extremely loose sense as any unquestioning faith that crushes human beings in the service of ideology. Furthermore, I do not think that most religious believers in the world use religion in the way described in the book, although too many do. The real problem is broader than fanatical religion, and is the problem of human attraction to fanatical faiths of any kind.	2005-09-25

Roche is a prolific translator and he is, for the most part, a competent one. But there were a number of mistakes that would be inexcusable coming from a student, as they should be. The glossary in the back is the worst of it, with drastic errors including an inaccurate account of the iliad, a jumbling of two different diomedes into one, and a number of other careless mistakes. I would hope these are not the result of Roche's own misinformation. i dont see how they could be, i would assume instead that these are typos that were never corrected, perhaps due to a sub-par editor. The magnitude of Roche's undertaking certainly bears well in excusing him, as he has translated a very large volume of work here. And his translation is, for the most part, solid.

The insight of the author, Mark Leonard, to be able to express how without love,a need to belong, structure in our lives, recognition, affirmation from early childhood to adulthood is so important. Starting with our parents, family, acquaintances and those we look up to have such an overwhelming effect on future relationships throughout our lives. <br /> <br />I believe that this book belongs be on every bookshelf in  schools, bookstores for every young adults and adults to read.  Especially, if they do not have anyone in their life to hear their heart's cry.  My first thought after I read this book was how this young author had the insight ablity to write this book with a desire to help change lives. To understand the need for love, relationship, approval and support in order to be successful in life. The understanding to life's journey and how one can change their life no matter what circumstance have been placed in their path. In life we have choices especially when we have a personal relationship with the Lord and know how much He love us even if no one else does.  He is the stream of life in our desert. He fills our empty well and quenches our thirsty heart.  <br /> <br />This book will enable the reader to see many issues that they have experienced and understand that they are not alone in these circumstances.  One particular chapter spoke on being invisible that really touched home for me. I couldn't put the book down.   Carmela	2005-09-25

Detective Sergeant Ray Barkley and Detective Nina Preston lead the investigation that has two other links besides the so-called victims being abusive male predators.  All the dead men walked free after their assault case was heard in the courtroom of Criminal Court Judge Carole Cranston and their female victims recovered at the Rose City Women's Shelter; coincidentally or vigilante Judge Cranston donates plenty of money to the facility.<br /><br />Nina believes the circumstantial evidence enhanced by the Judge's attitude towards male abusers make her, the guilty party.  On the other hand Ray likes the Judge and is convinced she is innocent.  Nina assumes he is thinking with the wrong head.  Is Carole a frustrated judge who has crossed the line or just the foci of an avenging angel?<br /><br />The magic behind R. Barri Flowers' terrific suspense thriller is that the serial killer is in plain sight as the clues are laid out for the audience to determine whether Carole is the Vigilante or not.  The story line is action-packed as the two cops follow leads that each interprets differently as Ray wants Her Honor innocent while Nina is totally convinced otherwise.  Fans of police procedural serial killer thrillers will want to read this fine tale while anxiously waiting to follow the next investigation, the opening tickler being the abduction of the Mayor's daughter.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-09-25

While C has a simple syntax, and lacks object oriented complexity in notation, there are many nuances that catch out unwary programmers.<br /><br />A lot of the questions revolve around the assembly language-like constructs in C, for pointer arithmetic. Very easy to trip up here. And also in the related area of memory (buffer) allocation.<br /><br />If that is not enough to keep you busy, Summit also talks about issues of portability across different operating systems or across different versions of the same operating system. At least you usually don't have to worry about the version of C itself. For system dependencies, Summit covers both unix and MSDOS. While C and unix grew up together, a reality is that much C programming goes on under Microsoft.<br /><br />The references to MSDOS in the text reflect that the book was written in 95. Though even then, Microsft was deprecating DOS in favour of its newer Windows offerings. A newer version of this book might be overdue. Where Summit would no doubt discuss C under XP.	2005-09-25

In my opinion, that's a good thing.  The book described on the back is seriously in danger of falling into a \"too cute by half\" trap.  The actual novel is a bit more serious. Main characters die.  The heroes aren't invincible.  But in the end everything is still wrapped up in a neat little package, while leaving room for the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />Some reviewers found the change in perspective from one chapter to another jarring, and a more experienced writer could have found a way to move the plot along without the \"back and forth\" to other characters. A tighter focus on the main character Livak would probably have improved the book.  I could certainly have done without the comic sub-plot entirely.  But i found the characters of Planir and Otrick entertaining and think the book would have lost some charm without them.  More of them would probably have made the book better, although it would require more shift from first person to third person narrative which others found so disturbing.<br /><br />It's nice that the author includes relationships among the characters that move beyond the \"brothers in arms\" comraderie or \"me good, you evil\" approach typical of most fantasy novels.  These characters fall in love, form relationships, and don't always get along with each other.  Just like real people.<br /><br />It's not a great novel, but it is a fun read and an engaging bit of fantasy fluff.  A good choice for anyone looking for a beach or commute novel.  Nothing terribly demanding, just good fantasy fun.	2005-09-25

Captain Bolger places you in the hot seat, as a company commander trying to juggle too many demands and too little information, huddled over a chemlight on a tank-torn bit of muddy road and wondering how he can possibly get the armor from where it is to where it needs to be...before the OPFOR rolls him up.

He is the bane and inspiration of seminarians, as often taken to task for things he did not say or mean as for things that he did.<br /><br />Of course, he resists simple categorisation, and those who respond or react to his theology also do not fall along simple lines of being Tillichian or anti- or non-Tillichian.  Borrowing from a contemporary German theologian, Karl Barth, Paul Tillich might have said, 'If there are Tillichians, I am not among them.'<br /><br />This book consists of five essays, papers presented in a symposium to address Tillich's impact at the end of his career.  Written in 1966, a year after Tillich's death, his career was cause for much retrospection - this was only a few years after the third volume of his magnum opus, 'Systematic Theology', was published.  Tillich's key ideas such as the Ground of Being and the Method of Correlation were still fresh and new ideas (now they are considered more classic ideas).  Tillich was as much a philosopher as a theologian, concerned about the general attack theology as a discipline underwent from other academic fields, particularly philosophy, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br /><br />One contributor, Nels F.S. Ferre, takes Tillich to task for being a bit too much of a philosopher and theologian in separate ways; another contributor, Charles Hartshorne, dislikes Tillich's tendency to use ordinary nontheological language to express key theological ideas.  John Dillenberger argues that Tillich's breadth is little understood, and Joseph Haroutunian argues that Tillich is in fact an opponent of all secularist thinking.  While some argue that Tillich relies too much of the history of religions, others such as James Livingstone argues the opposite, that Tillich pays too little attention to history, particularly the history of the development of Christology.<br /><br />Editor T.A. Kantonen describes the impact of Tillich as being similar to that of Origen or Aquinas.  Time will tell, but it seems like these comparisons are a bit overdone; still, Tillich's influence continues to be felt in seminaries and theological circles, and is likely to continue as one of the major voices in Protestant theology for the next generation or two.ct of Tillich as being similar to that of Origen or Aquinas.

Not only is there a cultural gap we must overcome, with many unrelatable similes and analogies,  but Feng's foreign style of writing can also distance some readers.   <br />This novel generally addresses the concept of new and old, deception and truth, through the transitional idea of foot-binding and unbinding in the \"old\" Chinese culture to the \"new\" Chinese culture.  The phases of binding and unbinding represents the fickle unwillingness to let go of the past, and the adjustment to the new, which draws parallel to the Cultural Revolution.  The foot binding also represents the suppression of society, through its deformation and excruciating pain, all for the sake of an ideal.  The repetitive process of the binding and unbinding reveals the profound deception and illusion of beauty.  It greatly signifies the non-existence of true beauty, as the Chinese slowly conform to yet another \"supreme\"  natural, ideal of beauty.  I believe this novel cannot have its full effect on a foreign reader, as the concept of foot-binding is something we have never accustomed to.  The idea of foot binding is alien and disgusting to us, so we already have a natural disposition to favour the \"new\" and \"natural\" Chinese society.

Imagine my disappointment when I found that I could hardly finish the book!  A dedicated owner of four intelligent, well-socialized, handsome and friendly Boston Terriers I was for one thing insulted by the malicious humor used by the author to discuss her encounters with Boston Terriers.  Although she claims she always wanted one, she certainly did a job of demeaning their intelligence, socialization, looks (her daughter was afraid their eyes would fall out), etc.  In fact, her comments about just about every other breed were malicious and I didn't enjoy the \"killer dog\" stories at all.  If I had a relative with dogs like that I would never tell anyone.  It was a struggle to keep reading and I never did find much I felt I could \"laugh out loud\" about.  In fact, I found myself wondering if the author really liked dogs at all.  Very, very disappointing.	2005-09-24

At first thought that seems preposterous. But think of it this way: instead of competing in a grueling physical activity, the participants in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament compete in an equally grueling mental one. And oddly enough, they gather together in order to perform a solitary activity. They race through timed puzzles at a breakneck pace in spite of the fact they normally solve puzzles at their leisure. Above all else, they get the opportunity to socialize with fellow crossword enthusiasts and have a good time.<br /><br />Here's your chance to match your solving skills against those of the tournament masters. This collection, edited by American Crossword Puzzle Tournament founder Will Shortz, contains all 56 of the tournament puzzles from 1998 to 2004 in chronological order, along with their time limits and the actual solving times of the participants. This allows you to compare your time against theirs. The only shortcoming is that, in the interest of simplified scoring, you can compare only your solving time and not your accuracy. In reality, the participants receive a point score that includes both factors.<br /><br />The puzzles in the book are the cream of the crop from noted puzzle constructors, and they range in difficulty from simple to devilishly difficult. There is a list of the winners in each year's contest since 1978. Interspersed among the puzzles are photos of solvers and constructors, along with tournament preparation and solving advice from the participants. If you think you've got what it takes to perform competitive crossword puzzle solving but can't make it to the annual Stamford Connecticut tournament, this book is the next best thing to being there!<br /><br />Eileen Rieback	2005-09-24

Mirror to the sky opens along similar lines to Arthur C. Clarke's classic Childhood's End.  As in Clarke's novel, mysterious aliens from beyond our solar system make contact with our planet and appear willing to help mankind in their fashion.  But whereas Clarke's aliens, santanic in appearence, ultimately enable mankind to reach transcendence with a cosmic overmind, Geston's aliens appear almost godlike in their perfection but, as time progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that they have their own agenda.  Mirror to the sky functions as a fasacinating counter-aurgument to the optimism of Clarke's work.  By contrast, Geston's future appears dilapidated and weary, but honest.	2005-09-24

The biggest problem with a national sales tax is that it ties the country&#8217;s revenues even more tightly to the economy.

Telling you much about his life might spoil the story for you, but suffice to say he's a very interesting character.<br /><br />I picked this book to read because I was looking for some good reading of ancient battles, and the book began with a bang in this regard. I settled in for a Roman-esq version of The Ten Thousand, with constant combat and hardships. The more I read, the more I realized that this book was less combat intensive, and more focused on the characters, which made it a much better read for me.<br /><br />Ford mentions in the postscript that there is a wealth of information avaliable on the life of Julian, and I think he was able to use that to his advantage. This book is very much focused on his and Caesarius' lives, and how the interact with one another. The main conflict in the book, aside from Julian against the world, is the old world (paganism) against the new world (christanity). The struggle is just covert enough to make up for the lack of legions marching into battle. Ford does an excellent job building up the characters to the inevitable conflict between the two worlds, and I have to say that I was surprised by how that conflict played out.<br /><br />The battles and the world were painted very well. In my opinion, Ford did a much better job in this book of putting the reader in the world than in The Ten Thousand.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-23

Indeed, I believe he is one of the best historic writers around today.<br /><br />As an admitted layperson who may not have the expertise of other reviewers, I mainly look for a book with an easy-to-follow summary, containing many well-detailed maps, objective viewpoints of Northern and Southern leaders, and utilizes anecdotes from several participants.<br /><br />Rhea's book pretty much fits the bill as he praises and criticizes both Grant and Lee (both missed golden opportunities to achieve a decisive victory), describes in exacting detail manuevers and engagements, and contains well-made maps.  My major complaint is that since Rhea goes into so much detail in troop movements and battles, the book could have easily contained more than the 30 or so maps in the book.  Such exacting detail in troop movements can easily lose the reader.<br /><br />Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as the definitive title of the actions leading up to and including the Battle of Cold Harbor.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!	2005-09-23

But just like someone who eats a lot of hamburgers, I can also recognize a good steak.  Only the best of the Star Wars books would rate 4 stars from me, so this is not a cut in my book.  I'd have to rate this title at the level of a burger.  A good bar & grill burger.<br /><br />Star By Star was one of the very best of the NJO novels, so I know what Denning is capable of.  Joiner King nearly holds up to this standard, but not quite.  The plot is excellent, a real page-turner.  Scene changes would be annoying at first, but within a couple paragraphs I would be captured again.  As I believe RA Salvatore said, Denning is great at balancing all the parts of a complex story.<br /><br />Another good point is the presentation of the collective mind of the alien insect race, very insightful.  There is a mystery plot point that really draws you in, and is very well done.  Raynar Thul is resurrected from Young Jedi Knights, and was a great choice.  I find the Jedis' new Force sensibilities to be less than pleasing, but it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment here.  At the end of the book, Leia is portrayed as finally ready to commit to some Jedi training.  I sure hope that is the case.<br /><br />The main problem I had was occasional treatments of the traditional, Lucas-created characters.  Denning was too obvious at times in trying to recreate their auras.  For example, too many references to Han Solo's different quirky facial expressions.  And there were at least two places where he evoked certain character qualities, only to follow with a behavior or some dialog that was contradictory to what had just been described.  Sure, these characters have evolved over time, but then why evoke traits that should now be less prevalent?<br /><br />That said, I can't imagine how hard it must be keeping track of everything that has been written about these characters, and writing in such an established arena.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend to those who enjoy the Star Wars expanded universe.  Also, for those who have yet to read the NJO series - although this series takes place after the NJO, I think it can stand alone, if you would like to try these first.erything that has been written about these characters, and writing in such an established arena. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend to those who enjoy the Star Wars expanded universe.

I have taken on the task of reading as many books about it as possible and then passing along what might be helpful for individuals. <br /> <br />If you have done lots of research like I have, this book is basically a refresher. However, the author does not go into much detail about her program - which includes, massage, nutrition advice, etc. Each is dealt with in one or two pages and I came away with the thought that I'd have to buy more of her stuff to get a really good idea of the program. <br /> <br />The book was very good about showing the progression of the disease, possible causes/triggers and the effects it can have on your life. The author is very candid about her personal life before and after diagnosis. This part alone may make it worthwhile for the newly diagnosed. I can definitely see people reading it and saying \"Aha!

Briefly, during each planetary round, every kingdom or life-wave goes through seven stages of development on each globe. In the human kingdom, these stages are called root-races or humanities. The root-races overlap: a new race begins in the middle of the previous one. Each root-race contains the same egos that were evolving in the preceding root-race.<br /><br />As a general rule, a root-race lasts for two mahâ-yugas (8.64 million years). During the first mahâ-yuga, the race reaches its zenith. A racial cataclysm then ensues, and during the second mahâ-yuga the old race slowly dies out while a new one emerges and pursues its evolution towards maturity. The fifth race in particular will last for two mahâ-yugas. The fourth race lasted somewhat longer, the sixth and seventh races will be slightly shorter, and the first three races were considerably longer.<br /><br />CW Leadbeater through his clairvoyant visions, delineates his findings on this subject matter.<br /><br />Heady stuff.

After completing graphic design courses in a New York City school, the topic of small business logos and how they're different from corporate logos was never once dicussed or explored. How often is it realistic to think that as designers, freelance or otherwise, that we'll be asked to create an identity for a large corporate client? The fact is that there are many times more small business than large corporate clients for whom we'll do work-- and we're never really shown direction on how to approach their needs. <br /> <br />This book, as well as the first one, really show and remind us of what we see around town on a daily basis, and how to design for those small businesses in a great an impactful way.

Too many  people of our political persuasion have receded into cynicism and  defeatism and have abandoned our movements. One of the book's purported  goals is to rescue those who feel this tendency.    Unfortunately, I'm not sure overly romantic snapshops of left-wing social  movements will be very effective in the production of more successful  strategy in the future. There's a reason a good many of these movements  failed, a reason that goes beyond just the blanket reference to the  monolithic corporate-military state. The volume appreciates the movements  but doesn't bother to criticize what their agents did wrong, something  that leftists sorely need, much more so than the knowledge that these  movements existed. A previous reviewer notes this is a children's version  of Howard Zinn. I'd agree, and it suffers from all the problems of Zinn's  work. See Michael Kazin's review of Zinn in Dissent at for more.

If you are a computer science student, you must learn these at a level that you can at least facilely code using them. What language you do it in is probably secondary. Well here, Lewis and Chase instantiate the pedagogy in Java. A good choice. They have updated this second edition so that it uses Java 1.5 (aka Tiger).<br /><br />They assume you have a rough working knowledge of Java. This is not the time or place to go over basic syntax. Though you should already know the basics of object oriented programming, they give an entire chapter to thoroughly discussing how to do so. In this chapter, you should pay close heed to the section on interfaces. More than many other aspects of Java, interfaces help you build modular code. To explicitly reduce the coupling between different classes, where one class might call the other. Instead of doing a direct call, if interfaces are used to mediate this instantiation, it is a huge boost to modular design. My only gripe here with the interface text is that I think it does not stress enough how useful this is. Only when you've tried to do a large project might you fully appreciate using interfaces.<br /><br />Later chapters show you how the base Java comes with a rich assortment of very useful classes. That implement queues, linked lists, lists, stacks, trees and collections. These can match or even exceed what is available on these topics in the C++ Standard Template Library. While poor old C totally lacks them.<br /><br />I suggest also that you scan closely the chapter on hashing. This is a key and fundamental idea in computing. Lets you search a table in logarithmic dependence on its size, instead of linear dependence. Another excellent Java class.<br /><br />If you want to improve your skill in Java, you need to move beyond just knowing the basic syntax and making UIs. Both these leave you exposed to junior programmers or offshore programmers. Whereas having a deep understanding of the book's topics is harder to learn. Gives you more of a barrier against those who do not know this material. More value added skills.<br /><br />Also, one day you might have to code in another language. The skills here are far more portable between languages.shore programmers. Whereas having a deep understanding of the book's topics is harder to learn.

It appears that the author assumes readers will already have a good understanding of calculus, vectors, and a somewhat advanced knowledge of electrostatics and electromagnetism! Readers without this background will likely struggle with the material! <br /> <br />I have a reasonable background (to tertiary level) in mathematics and electrical engineering, but I still found this book difficult to follow in many parts! <br /> <br />The reviews of theory at the beginning of chapters, are a bit too brief and therefore difficult to understand! <br /> <br />Many solved calculations leave out intermediate steps, which makes it difficult to follow. The calculations should include all steps in their derivation and solutions, so that there would be no misunderstanding on how the solutions are determined. <br /> <br />Therefore, this edition is NOT recommended for most people. This book is apparently only suitable for people who have a thorough knowledge of electrostatics, electromagnetics, calculus, and vectors. <br /> <br />To make this book more practical and attractive to others, the material needs to be rewritten and expanded!	2005-09-23

For anyone interested in a more complete understanding of how we got where we are today this is a must read. This book captures the history and details of our relationship with the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia, and the impact it has had on our Middle East policy or in many cases lack thereof. Especially noteworthy is how little attention or the lack of any US policy was in effect for post-Soviet Afghanistan. Detailing how both Pakistan and Afghanistan throughout the 80's and 90's became a hotbed for training terrorists. The paperback edition includes notes from the 9/11 commission - though the commission findings are now proving to be incomplete (i.e. lack of inclusion of the findings from recently discovered \"Able Danger\"). Most profound are administration decisions based on the time and the global situation at that time with the unforeseen impact on unknowingly financing our enemies. The disheartening reality of foreign policy is you can never predict who will be friend or foe. In an ever changing world what is a good decision today does not guarantee a good outcome tomorrow just as a bad decision does not always guarantee a bad outcome. Coll provides a detailed account of the early 80's US policy to defeat the USSR through aid of Afghan rebels, and recounts how we provide direct financial support and unwittingly contribute to the rise of the Taliban, the Mujahideen, even allowing Bin Laden to open offices on US soil. Although Coll mentions we knew of Bin Laden in 1985 there is no indication that he would be a future threat. You see the seed being planted, nourished, and ultimately harvested for Anti-American sentiment and terrorist actions throughout mosques in the United States. The rise of Saudi funded Madrassas/religious schools in Pakistan through the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs is particularly disturbing.  We must heed the warnings that are presented and grasp the absolute criticality of our war on terror and why our enemy will not sleep until they die or win.  The stark reality of the origins of our current geopolitical situation as set forth in this book should provide the West with multiple ideas on combating terrorism, identifying who and where the enemy is, and what our response should be.  Steve Coll gives you the harsh facts in this extremely well written book - read with a purpose.	2005-09-23

They enjoy our grammer lesson over breakfast - 1 lesson per day from the book. I guess we could do more as they do not take long, but I like to give my kids the chance to think about the things we have discussed. I also think the repitition another day is benificial too. If my children have memorized the definition or poem well, we tend not to repeat it 3 times that day.  I read a previous reviwers comments about how boring it was to study nouns for so many lessons, but that comment was made before this parent had actually completed these lessons.  In actual fact within these lessons your child will learn many other things:  Family relationships, days of the week, months, seasons, which months are in each season, several poems will be memorized, some oral usage, rules for capitalization, they will be encouraged to speak in proper sentences, they will learn to write their address, you will read stories, narrate pictures, and if your child is like mine he/she will retain it all.

They required entirely too much arithmetic to be useful before the age of computers. But with computers the whole concept of fractals became something that could indeed be studied.  <br /> <br />A bit of time goes by and all of a sudden the people doing fractals begin to discover that using the right kind of mathematics can be used to produce a lot of images that begin to look like things in nature. These drawings began to look like things such as trees, mountains, clouds, explosions. And all of a sudden there was an interest beyond those of the mathematician just drawing cute geometric patterns, it's called game development.  <br /> <br />This book is not on gaming, it's on the basics of fracticals. It includes software to generate fractals, and it gives the mathematics of how these fractals are created. It's a basic, beginners book to computer graphics at the mathematical level.	2005-09-22

Its rituals are inspired, its traditions strong, and its graduates well paid and highly in demand.  Lest you wonder,  high pay is because they are clever.  And if you have any question about how clever they are, just read about the (fictional) puzzle they solve here.  <br /> <br />And if  one reads the story this way, it's a 'junk novel', 'pulp fiction.' A two star book. A book about a couple guys who spend too much time in steam tunnels and too much time solving five hundred year old riddles and not enough time feasting at the table of upper-crustiness that the institution sets for them.   <br /> <br />Inside this wrapper is a story set at the cusp between the Renaissance and the Reformation.  A Renaissance pulpit-pounder makes it his task to reform wayward Florence, burning its humanistic relics in a 'bonfire of the vanities.'   And a rich aristocrat defies him.  Though its ( partly fictional) details are sketched out at the climax of the book, it constitutes too little of the story to completely redeem the book. <br /> <br />Scattered through the book is a third story.  This one is about obsession.  Most superhuman efforts and great  achievements are the result of  obsession.  And even when obsession causes relations between loved ones to languish, sometimes our obsessions give us what we need most, a sort of raison d'etre.  Still, to the question of obsession the book brings more heat than light.    <br /> <br />In the end it is hard to see the book as much more than a coming-of-age story. Two students' sheer obsession provides the impulse power for them to gnaw through the multi-layered cryptographic tricks played by a Renaissance author. They reveal a message that  we remain unconvinced is worth the effort.  Theirs or ours.	2005-09-22

Boston detective Mike Coady calls in Clevenger when it is indeterminate as to whether this was a case of suicide or murder.<br /><br />Snow was on the threshhold of a breakthrough in revolutionary stealth missile technology which would provide a huge financial windfall for his company and partner Collin Corroway.  The unhappily married Snow was being inspired in his thought processes by his mistress gorgeous but troubled and also married art dealer Grace Baxter.  Apparently Snow's surgery to be performed by accomplished neurosurgeon Dr. Jet Heller, had the potential to cause selective amnesia as a byproduct.  Snow would lose the memories of all those that had a part in his life, family and lover included.<br /><br />Fantastically Baxter herself was found days after Snow's demise, apparently having taken her own life by slashing her wrists and neck.  Questions arose as to whether she also might have been murdered.<br /><br />Ablow conveniently bestowed upon all the peripheral characters in this book including Snow's wife, son and daughter, business partner, Baxter's husband George Reese and even Dr. Heller enough financial and emotional baggage to make them strong suspects in Snow's murder.  Clevenger must wade through all the rhetoric to solve this improbable case.  Ablow's conclusion is melodramatic and ridiculously farfetched.	2005-09-22

I was happy to see that the overall rating for the Columbus Book of Euchre has gone back to four stars. It was just awful to see all of those one and two star ratings coming in during the past few months. After all, Mr. Bumppo does have a good book. And it was so dirty for other reviewers to put him down. They have no right to give him less than four stars! I guess if you can't say anything nice, then don't take the time to review any book. And Mr. Bumppo was able to get back to four stars in the easiest way possible. He simply whined to Amazon, and they immediately culled out most of the negative reviews. <br /> <br />Anything less than four stars is not acceptable, even if a reader's opinon is less than positive.  In summary, if you don't like the Columbus Book of Euchre, then don't say anything! This is still a good euchre book. <br /> <br />I say that we start a campaign, and send in five star reviews. The more the merrier. If 22 people send in a five star review, then we get the rating up to five stars. Here is what a five star review for this book might look like: <br /> <br />   The Columbus Book of Euchre - 5 Stars! <br /> <br />\"This is the best Euchre Book ever written. It just blows away the other Euchre Books. It is beautifully bound, with heavy weight pages, and a gorgeous red cover with fantastic black ink, and eye-popping letters. The Columbus Book of Euchre is lavishly illustrated with color pictures - many of them full sized. There is an intriguing history of Euchre, followed by a full Glossary of terms. Then, Mr. Bummpo really rolls up his sleeves, and dives into the game of Euchre. You will be mesmerized by his defintions. He will rock your world with up-to-date Euchre strategy. You will learn how the game is played in other regions. Finally, Mr. Bummpo sets the record straight as to why his book is light years ahead of the other Euchre Books. When you start reading this book, it will be like having the Great Master himself, in your living room, or at your computer - teaching you all aspects of Euchre. Mr. Bummpo is so great that he can admit his only fault - he does not know just how great he is! Don't wait - be great, order The Columbus Book of Euchre today. In Bummpo, We Trust\"	2005-09-22

Caroline Cabot is doing all she can to keep her sisters afloat financially. Taking up the reins when her parents passed on eight years ago, as the oldest she feels responsible for sisters Vivienne and Portia. And since Caroline is now considered well on the shelf at the ripe age of 24 she decides the smartest thing to do is to let Vivienne make her debut in London and hopefully return with a wealthy husband that can save them from their dyer straights.  <br /> <br />It doesn't take long before Vivienne does indeed catch the attention of a rather wealthy Earl. Unfortunately it is rumored throughout the ton that he is a vampire. Not one to fall for flights of fancy and silly notions Caroline tries to write it off. Unfortunately, Portia, her youngest sister who lives for the dramatic, won't let it go and now they have been invited by the Earl to attend a midnight dinner. <br /> <br />From here the book takes flight in wonderful states of misdirection and humor. And Caroline, who has all the best intentions of either giving her blessing or saving her sister, is finding it harder and harder to resist Lord Trevelyan's magnetism.  <br /> <br />After Midnight was a fun and fascinating read. Teresa Medeiros manages to keep the plot twisting through the whole book. Her words are wonderfully descriptive giving every impression of a vampire in their midst. I truly had a hard time putting this book down. I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamics between the sisters. Their lightness and humor contrasted well with dark seriousness of Lord Trevelyan. And I must say Ms. Medeiros knows how to tighten the knot of sexual tension as the book unravels and the truth is finally revealed. <br />	2005-09-22

It is maneagable for the younger readers, but seriously, no adult should like this book.<br /><br />The writing is horrible, Paolini breaks the story to go into backfill and destroys the flow. He uses far too many words and he tells us what he could SHOW us. Infodumping is abound. Unnecesary explanations and redundancy plagues the entire book.<br /><br />The charcters are all just fancy names. There is no distinguishing between them. Take any piece of dialogue and change the character saying it. It will NEVER sound out of place. They change who they are to suit Paolini's needs.<br /><br />Paolini has no credibility as a writer whatsoever. As mentioned many tiems before, he writes emotions the way he percieves them to be, not as he feels them. When Eragon has love problems, I felt no sympathy, because if Paolini had wiritten heartbreak like it is, it would change my whole perspective. Thse characters are cardboard cutouts, and I have no emotion for them.<br /><br />And the cliches. Oh my the cliches. The whole plot is Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. With Dragonriders of Pern thrown in for good measure. I could list the parallels between this and Star Wars series, but that would be a waste of time. I'm sure doing so yourself woul increase the enjoyment of this mediocre novel. The man has written NOTHING original, whatsoever. Except perhaps the exceedingly infuriating idea that elves are impossibly stronger than humans, no matter what. The way the book ends makes me think that the Galbatorix will be thrown down an energy shaft by (You know who for all that have read the ending.)<br /><br />I myself am an aspiring writer, and I cannot read this story without thinking \"I can do better than that!\" and \"What the hell did he tell us all that for?\" or \"Why is this dialogue so unrealistic?\" and the ever so common \"Why is he telling us this? If he just had ___ do ___, we could see that instead of reading this useless paragraph.\" If novice writers think this while reading your novel, then you have seriosuly doen SOEMTHING wrong.<br /><br />The only emotion I ever got from this book was to the end, when I was wondering \"How long will it be before the traitor shows up? Who is the traitor, and how is he related to Eragon? (As he inevitably will be.)<br /><br />The worst thing about this is that this overhyped, ovveratted and ultimaltely mediovre waste of time is making Master Paolini a fortune, while the media and the ignorant push this book onto others. Meanwhile the next Issac Asimov is struggling t oget into a Sci-Fi magazine (I'm not reffering to myself, I have to completed works as yet, because unlike Paolini I plan my characters deeply to that they are 3D not paper thin.) He even has the nerve to compare himself to Heany and Tolkien. He even writes poetry and songs in an attempt to mimick Tolkien! (Those too are atrocious, for all the verses he wrote I have yet to  find an acceptable tune for one!)<br /><br />I'm not a person who likes to hate books. If it is of a genre I enhoy (such as this) I will read it, and I will enjoy reading it, even if it is subpar. However, today I make an exception.

Never mind that Pres. Bush showed more decency and resolve than his predecessor (fmr Pres.

Remarkably, his only taker in New Jersey is St. Rose, a private Catholic School. Although Jewish, there is a prompt mutual respect between the team and Bloom. At this point in the book, Bloom has been coaching his team for several years but every summer he faces a challenge in team depth and symptoms of a summer of too little training. With his skeleton team, Bloom develops and gets to know each individual. He works personal motivation, skill in workouts, a touch of psychology and a mix of father figure and teacher together to help guide the boys through life. The book is surprisingly personal as Bloom reveals much of himself, his past and his family along with his own running experiences as he in turn learns about the boys under his tutelage. Bloom acts as a total coach knowing each boy's personality, personal conflicts and athletic needs while providing versatile training that promotes a team running style while also perfecting their training to the course they will run on at the Parochial Class B Championship. There is a great blend of faith as Bloom shares in their prayer before each race, holds a boys crucifix while he runs hoping that rubbing it will power the boy forward and at other times touching his own mezuzah for the same reach of faith and power. The final race is exhilarating as the boys give a tremendous effort and do run as a team as there coach has continual emphasized. Whether they win or not, they run as great heart, each one showing great improvement. The final sprint to the end is exciting as you literally sprint with the coach along the course to see how they finish. Without peeking at the end, you will find their final efforts surpisingly rewarding. Throughout the book, Bloom discusses the issues such as the detrimental effect hard training has on young girls, the effect multi-year sports has had on distance running (particular soccer) and insights to past great runners. The book may be more appealing to the mature runner as it's not all races and training but a look back at Bloom's life from mid life with an introspective look at the boys' lives and future as well. The book will be a treat for those former cross-country runners who enjoyed the simple purity of the sport and who also know that when the summer final cools, making your sweat turn cold, its cross-country season.had on distance running (particular soccer) and insights to past great runners.

Some of the reviews, sadly almost half, appear to have an overdose of venom in them. I didn't understand it for the books are wonderful (Yes I am an adult, and do read alot especially with in this genre), but then I discovered the hype surrounding the author of this book, specifically his age.  And I surmise that his age is the very idea that incites such venom in most of these negative reviews. It's jealosy.  The book is not poorly written. It has a good story, nice characters, and incredible sense of mobility.  The book should not be judged by the age of its author or the incredible amount of hype surrounding the author. Is it any different then the rags to riches story of J K Rowling, or the Dunkin Donuts Stephen King story. It's a great read, it deserves to be popular. ANd it should not be hated for the hype. Although concerning the hype; the author Paolini, and his achievements appears to be the greatest endorsement of homeschooling that I have ever encountered. Good book, nice work, and I hope that the third one is just as good....although I must admit that i am not as excited now for the third one as I was for the second one.

Lisa J. Peck does an outstanding job giving the reader a glimpse into the life of Charlene, an LDS middle-aged woman with several kids, blazing a trail of hope and courage through an abusive marriage, subsequent divorce, single motherhood and reentry into the 'dating world.' <br /> <br />It should be noted that though this book deals with mature issues of domestic violence, divorce, health issues and internet dating, it is surprisingly upbeat and will leave you with a positive feeling of accomplishment for the main character. It may not be suitable for younger readers. <br /> <br />As an adult male and husband, I was not sure what to expect when I began reading it, but I am glad that I did. It opened my eyes to serious topics generally not mentioned in LDS circles, though they apply to us as much as they do to the nation. My wife and I both were amazed at the accuracy with which the book describes the physical as well as mental and emotional trauma one can suffer in abusive relationships. Someone close to us recently went through a similar trial in her life, and it was uncanny to see the similarities between her experience and the book.  <br /> <br />Escaping the Shadows is a must-read for singles and married couples alike. It was both enlightening as to serious matters, yet fun and uplifting so as to enjoy.	2005-09-22

The love scenes are ample & steamy, and the plot is a good one. A fast paced book with an intricate plot that I cannot help but enjoy. What a Woman Needs has a strong (but not obnoxious) heroine who is in no way ordinary, a back story which is compelling but doesn't get in the way of the love story, and of course a wonderful hero. Both the hero and the heroine have secrets of their own, which are slowly brought to light by the author, like layers being peeled from a (very good) onion....<br /><br />It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with the palatable passion and keen scents of danger in the story. The relationship between the leads is endearing. The secondary characters are enjoyable as well.

The French, says Ms. Stein, will \"leave you inside of you completely to yourself\".  That, she suggests, is why so many artists chose to make Paris their home.

Young Buster worked as a newsboy and a caddy, and enjoyed sports especially football and boxing. He tells of his job at the Bank of Commerce (pp.20-21). Buster traveled around the country doing various jobs which prepared him to become a stuntman. He had other jobs and businesses; people learned never to cross him (p.37).   Part II tells of his work as a stuntman in Hollywood pictures, and scenes off-camera. Her worked with Errol Flynn and became friends due to their sports interests. Errol’s father was a Professor of Marine Biology at Queen’s College in Belfast Ireland. Buster tells of his work in “High Sierra” where he played the rifleman who shot “Roy Earle”, then doubled for Bogart to fall down the mountain (p.90). His main training was to run seven miles a day. After Pearl Harbor Errol Flynn was deferred due to heart murmur and tuberculosis (kept secret). Flynn did work for British intelligence (pp.112-113). Flynn sold War Bonds, and visited Alaska to entertain soldiers.   Part III tells of his life after quitting the movie business; aches and pains took longer to heal. Buster worked as an agent for jockeys, and traveled up and down the Pacific Coast. His advice for betting on horses is on page 175. Buster loved the excitement of gambling, but his winnings often disappeared as fast as he got them. Buster was shocked to hear of Errol Flynn’s death, but he knew he lived fast. The legends about Flynn aren’t all true (p.185). Buster wrote this autobiography to correct the misinformation in the CBS film that fictionalized Flynn’s life (p.202). He sets the record straight.   The important part of this book is the Appendix by William Donati, who checked the sources for Higham’s biography. Wiles told of the lies in that book (p.208). Those who knew Flynn, like David Niven, didn’t believe that book (p.210). The declassified documents show that it was not Errol Flynn but Dr. Hermann Erben who was the subject of investigation. There was nothing to Higham’s story (pp.211-212). Dr. Erben first met Flynn in 1933 before Flynn began acting in Britain. Higham modified an official document to support his story (p.221)! Donati interviewed Dr. Erben (pp.229-237). Other examples of Higham’s errors are given (pp.249-260). If Charles Higham can’t be trusted (p.261) how reliable is his story? Does this controversy arise from the uncorroborated writings of Dr. Erben (p.264)? Did he create a notional agent for money?	2005-09-21

If we still attend church, the critical few are repeated on an annual basis. And the common scripture readings again cover these moments.  <br /> <br />In this book these stories are again repeated. But this time they are combined with a historical view that helps to present a more human view of Jesus, one where we might can view what the man had to go through. In the section on the crucifixion for instance, he talks of how this was a Roman punishment. He adds understanding to the whipping administered beforehand. The Mel Gibson showed this most graphically. But the author points out that the condemned often died under this preliminary punishment, thus being spared the greater one to follow. <br /> <br />Of the crucifixion itself, the whole thing was designed to be as cruel as possible. Death often took two or three days to occur. Jesus was 'fortunate' in surviving only a few hours. And remember that in John, the people involved didn't want the event to continue so the soldiers were instructed to break the legs of the three on the crosses. This put all the weight on the arms and caused suffication to occur quickly.  <br /> <br />This little book provides a view that fills in background information to those told in the Bible	2005-09-21

Bill Phillips of \"Body for Life\" fame comes up with another winner with \"Eating for Life: Your Guide to Great Health, Fat Loss and Increased Energy\".<br /><br />The book is a scrumptious way to eat healthy, lose weight and feel better.  Bill's philosophy is that people should eat 5-6 healthy, size appropriate meals per day to keep blood sugars level and ward off fat. So the book is broken up into categories to eat at each of the meals: breakfast, desserts, lunches, midmeals, dinners and shakes.<br /><br />Each recipe comes with a mouthwatering full color photograph and detailed instructions on how to make it. There is also a handy little picture that shows the actual brandname ingredients used in the recipe. For example Albacore Tuna Casserole shows a large color photograph of the dish and another smaller photo with a picture of the ingredients in it; Bumble Bee tuna, Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup, Lucerne fat free milk, Healthy Harvest pasta and Birds Eye peas...what a neat idea!<br /><br />So far I have made a number of recipes from the book and they have all been delicious. There are a number of recipes such as Egg-Cellent Enchiladas, Golden Protein Pancakes, Cool Ranch Dip, Greek Pinwheels, Frosted Key Lime Pie (shake), Pina Colada (shake), Cilantro Burrito, Cool Taco Salad, Cajun Chicken,  Beef and Barley Soup and many more.<br /><br />The ingredients are easy to find and the recipes easy to prepare. Even if you are not on the Body for Life plan this is a wonderful cookbook to own.<br /><br />There is a major drawback with the book and that is the lack of nutritional information. Yes you can go on the BFL website and get this information, but you shouldn't have too. It should be right in the book. One of the drawbacks with not having this information is portion size. The recipes are designed to be BETWEEN a man and a woman's portion. That means for example that the recipe for Singapore Shrimp as shown and prepared in the book is about 374 calories per portion. BUT a man could eat 468 calories as his daily portion and a woman would have to modify the recipe to 281 almost 100 calories less! But it does not tell you this in the book. I only learned this from gathering the nutrition information on the site where it gives average portions and male portions and female portions.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book I don't care for is the use of foods like butterbuds (why not use a tiny portion of real butter) and fat free cheese and sour cream which I find tasteless. Instead I substitute tiny amounts of the tastier full fat version.<br /><br />I really had to debate on whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars. It is my favorite cookbook now and its helping me eat healthier...but the lack of nutritional information in the book is a major blunder especially when the portion sizes vary so much from male to female. I know Bill might say use your palm or fist, but thats hard to do for certain food products. Thus I have to give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Great recipes, beautiful layout..next time Bill give us the nutritional info. too!

The first born, Faith has always been first in the eyes of their parents. The two sisters are so close that they marry two guys that are best friends. After several years together, Isabel gives husband Will an ultimatum - she wants to start the family that he continues to put off, or she will leave him. Will then confesses that not only he is having an affair (again), but he fathered a child with his mistress. To Isabel's horror, the mistress was Faith, and the relationship lasted at least 3 years.<br /><br />Three months after leaving Will, Isabel is attending Faith and Will's funeral. The deceptive duo bundled up baby Tony, and were killed in a car crash. The only one to survive was baby Tony, who is now being raised by the only father he has ever known, Ben.<br /><br />Ben discovered the truth when searching for clothing to bring to the funeral home; he comes across Faith's Dear John letter admitting that Tony is not his child. Ben is terrified that he might lose his son, and enlists Isabel's help to keep the truth from her parents, who cling to anything having to do with Faith.<br /><br />Ben tries to use guilt first to get Isabel on his side, since she has had 3 months to recover from their spouses' infidelity, while he is still shell-shocked. Soon, the two are sharing close quarters, and starting to feel an attraction to each other. Is it just their way to get even with their cheating partners, or is Ben trying to seduce Isabel to get her to side with him? Isabel never feels like she can trust him or her own distrust after having her heart shattered by Will and Faith.<br /><br />Tensions, sibling rivalry, unresolved feelings, deception, and some pretty ballsy in-laws help to progress the melodramatic story. I thought at times it just bogged down so much with Ben and Isabel arguing about whether to tell her parents or not. I would have liked to see some passages including the adulterous couple - this would have made the story much more interesting. Typical HQN fare, with dialogue that is a little implausible at times.ple - this would have made the story much more interesting.

They weren't forced nor was there some law forcing the boys to participate.  More information about the government that created the Walk would have added to the horror of the novel.

It also contains hundreds of rare photographs from his many films. Authors Henderson and Randisi did extensive research, and uncovered several previously unknown George Reeves film appearances.  They even included for complete thoroughness several U.S. Army training films that Reeves made while serving in World War Two!       Every single film credit contains a plot narrative, detailed movie credits, and a great deal of intriguing film history regarding George Reeves and his co-players.  Movie fans, film buffs and historians will be delighted to discover that \"Behind The Crimson Cape: The Cinema Of George Reeves\" was written by Jan Alan Henderson and Steve Randisi in the format of the old Citadel 'Films Of ....' series, and will therefore become a priceless addition to their movie book libraries.      Even though George Reeves died suddenly and violently in 1959 at the still young age of 45, authors Jan Alan Henderson and Steve Randisi remind us that he was an incredibly gifted, multi-talented actor who displayed genuine star charisma.        There is a poignant epilogue to this book where the authors inform us that this volume was for readers to find the real legacy of George Reeves, his gallery of performances and body of work on motion-picture film.  They write that many people have tried to investigate the death of George Reeves, 'but after four and a half decades decades, no one has solved the crime! No one has come close.'  For once, the authorsare wrong.      There is one literary book that does solve the case on the mysterious death of George Reeves, or at least comes close enough so that the discerning reader can judge for him or herself.  That book is 'Speeding Bullet' published in 1999, and written by Jan Alan Henderson!	2005-09-21

In the near future biological advances allow parents to choose certain biological traits for their impending children, one of which is sleeplessness. At the outset, this \"child upgrade\" is highly sought after. Parents soon realize that the amount of work involved in raising a child who never sleeps is astronomical; it also takes a high psychological and physical toll on both parties.  <br /> <br />Once grown, the first group of sleepless is seen as a boon to society. Their advancements in science and economics are hailed as miracles. As more and more sleepless grow the \"sleepers\" start to realize that they are going to have to compete with a group that many see as having an unfair advantage. A schism starts to form in society between the sleepers and the sleepless.  <br /> <br />The novel follows mainly the Camden sisters- twins, Liesha and Alice. Liesha is a genetically altered sleepless who's birth was planned. However, another egg is fertilized accidentally during the pregnancy. Alice is the product of that accident; she is a completely unaltered sleeper. Envy and animosity abound on both sides.  <br /> <br />Nancy Kress has a real gift for characterization.

When the people with whom she shared these relationships begin to die all around her, Cynthia is frightened. Just in the nick of time, in rides a new man on a white horse to rescue her. Desperate for peace, Cynthia rides off into the sunset with him. Has she done the right thing? Will this finally be the love she has been searching for? Or is he just another relationship that she jumps into too quickly? We follow Cynthia and her daughter Chris as they both attempt to deal with Cynthia's new relationship.<br /><br />Shelly L. Foster has written a suspenseful novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you alternately root for Cynthia, or find yourself asking how an educated woman could be so dumb? Ms. Foster definitely has a way of submerging you in the life of Cynthia that makes you feel what she feels and see what she sees. It is a fast paced novel with smooth writing and no let down of suspense. It begs to be read in one sitting.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers<br /><br />**Review refers to the revised edition of this title.**	2005-09-21

In my opinion, those books are a fitting conclusion to the adventures of Belgarion and his friends, and will leave you eager to read more.<br /><br />Belgarion, the Child of Light, is still seeking the clues in order to know where to meet Zandramas, the Child of Darkness. Along the way, his former enemy Zakath (the Emperor of Mallorea) and some other unlikely companions will join his cause. Cyradis, the seeress of Kell will also be part of this journey, at the end of which she will have to choose between two new Childs of light and Darkness, in an event that will involve the fate of our friends but also that of the rest of the world.<br /><br />In my opinion, buying \"The Malloreon: volume two\" is a great idea, because it is an inexpensive and practical way of getting hold of the last two volumes in \"The Malloreon\" series. This volume doesn't take up too much space, but contains wonderful adventures that will keep you entertained, and laughing. On the whole, highly recommended  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: If you are one of the many fans that already read the series but wants to buy an extra copy of their very well-read books (my case), do it, but don't forget that Eddings also has other excellent series. I specially recommend the Elenium triology.	2005-09-21

When you close the book at the end you are left with an overwhelming glowing feeling.  You feel a true sense of God's love for ALL of us, a confirmation that we are all safe and protected regardless of the bumpy paths we take in this lifetime.  Personally, I am going through an extremely difficult time in my life.  I have a beautiful four year old child with a progressive, degenerative, life threatening illness.  Reading these stories of how others have overcome challenges in their lives has helped to bring me great comfort.  God loves us all no matter who we are, what we do, or what happens to us.  I have had plenty of sad moments, but I choose not to be bitter because of my situation.  This ordeal has actually brought me closer to God.  Now that's an unlikely way home!	2005-09-21

All the other books about the mysterious Black Dahlia fade beside John Gilmore's SEVERED.  I read the Granta edition in London last year, and recently finished the US edition.  I am reading it again.  The story, the superb writing, the strange tale draws you in.  A post-War time in Los Angeles comes to life and it is gritty and dirty, the people are driven by dog-eat-dog agendas.  The Black Dahlia is totally captivating. I feel like I know her, like she is real and I'm enamored with her. I can reach out and touch her. I've got author Gilmore to thank or curse for that!  The gangsters, sexpots, soldiers and sailors, the lonely hearts and killers are here. Also a handful of ordinary people like myself, caught by the charms or spells of the Black Dahlia as she steps from the darkness into your life.  This has to be a movie!	2005-09-21

I recommend it to anyone who is seeking to draw closer to God. The book is primarily an introduction to the Ignatian spiritual practice called \"The Daily Examen\"--one of the most helpful and simple prayer practices a person can do to become more aware of God's presence in their lives. The Linns tell stories, offer many ways to use the prayer and even have a section on how to use this prayer with small children. \"Sleeping with Bread\" looks like a children's book, but it's a profoundly deep yet accessible introduction to Ignatian spirituality, a gift our Jesuit friends share with all people who seek God--a gift that has great power to assist us in discerning God's desire for our lives. I buy this book in bulk to give to friends and spiritual direction clients--that's how much I like it.	2005-09-21

Certainly, as I began to read I actually thought that Solomon truly existed. During the trips to and from Detroit I could actualy see the roadway moving by. The language and general conversations were the most interesting elements as they were the true cataylst for the internal battles that Solomon was fighting. Through all of the grief, and at times curious police activites, I read Mr. Woods all the way through to the end. Only then did I realize Mr. Wiliams true genius in his ability to lead the reader to the conclusion, and only then revealing the fact that he was actually Solomon Woods. A very difficult time in Mr. Williams life but one which he has overcome through strength and faith. I hope that he will continue to give us more superb material. A Great Book!!.

From the moment you open this book you will be pleasently surprised, you'll notice that this book is read from top to bottom. And from that first page you get to read the full poem from start to finish first before even lifting a page. <br /> <br />The pages are made from rice paper as well and the illustrations from simply tearing  paper and paint. If your like me, your hands will imediately go to each page expecting to feel that soft texture threads that rice paper has,  or the texture of thick quick strokes of paint and then being sadly disappointed when you feel regular plain old paper pages. The rainbow of colors used are bright and so very rich!   <br /> <br />I love that the last two page show the Chinese characters both ancient & modern  characters  side by side so you can see how the characters changed from then to now. The Chinese characters are mountain peaks, tree, east, water, rain, river, boulder, through, sun, moon, many plants, metal, rice, hanging grain, ice, bamboo, hanging leaves, leek, fruit on a vine, hemp, west, salt, wine, jade, kindgon, center or middle and fire.  <br /> <br />I also love that in the middle of the author's notes inside a light pink circle in the middle of the page are thesewise and beautiful words.... <br /> <br />Be open to inspriation, <br />Inspiration leads to creativity. <br /> <br />Be open to play. <br />In play we see mistakes <br />as stepping-stones to fulfillment. <br /> <br />Be open to challenges, <br />Challenges offer us a chance to grow, <br /> <br />Be open to work. <br />It is in the willingness to labor <br />that we mature <br />and find excellence.	2005-09-20

Franz Wisner's memoir, \"Honeymoon with My Brother,\" centered on the many trips that he made with his brother from Central Europe to Western Europe, and then they proceeded to Asia, South America and finally Africa. Franz was left at the altar when his fiance, Annie changed her mind five days before their wedding. In addition, his career took a step back when he was sort of \"demoted\" from his position. Feeling that two of the most important aspects of his life were letting him down, he had a idea to continue the honeymoon that he had planned with Annie and took his brother Kurt with him to Costa Rica. After their vacation there, both Franz and Kurt realized that they would like to extend their travel to one year, exploring different places. Franz also considered that an opportunity to get to know his brother better. Soon, their one year travel became two and it was more than just an adventure for both of them. Throughout their travel, they developed a better understanding and appreciation for other cultures and basically learning to appreciate the \"little things\" in life. It was a journey of self-discovery for both of them. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed \"Honeymoon with My Brother\" as the writing was witty and definitely very fun. The quirky observations of the author also made the book a very interesting read, seeing the different places through his eyes. This book can also be considered a travel literature/travelogue but better, as there were a lot of insights and personal stories. It wasn't just the travel itself that was fascinating but the relationship that was build between the two brothers as well as re-discovering themselves and their world. This book is definitely worth your time and money. Highly recommended! <br />	2005-09-20

Most, if not all, Fantasy authors strive their entire lives to produce a work that will equal, much less excel, the legacy of Tolkien's epic.  The novel, published over 50 years ago, has been voted by Australia as the National Favorite Book of all time - and the mythology of Lord of the Rings, with Elves,  Dwarves, and Hobbits, has even entered into the American mainstream with Peter Jackson's Tri-Star blockbusters.  Tolkien's masterwork still captivates the hearts and minds of readers today just as it did when it was first published in the mid-1950s.  And so, if you're reading this review for more information about whether or not you'll like Lord of the Rings, as a novel, then I can offer no more than this: the 50th Anniversary edition of the novel is just as splendid, if not more so, as any edition.<br /><br />Since you are reading a review for the 50th Anniversary Edition of Lord of the Rings, I'm sure you are more interested in this specific edition of Tolkien's classic novel instead of critical review of the novel.  In that case, I'm sure that you're quite interested in what you see: a single volume edition of the Lord of the Rings, clothed in a black leather, gold trimmed pages, and complete with a slipcase to keep the actual book free from shelfware.  And these are only the external qualities!  Inside, you'll find heavy-duty crisp white pages which give extra emphasis to the printed text; you'll also find Tolkien's original pictures for the Book of Mazarbul (from the chapter The Bridge of Khazad-Dum), inserted just Tolkien originally desired; you'll also find two large scale fold out maps which give you the feeling that you, too, are embarking upon this journey to Mordor!  All in all, these additions make an already excellent story into something even more special.  In fact, just by purely owning it, I can't help but feel that I have an \"inside\" ticket to the world Hobbits, Elves, and Dwarves!<br /><br />The only downside to this edition is the fact that it is rather heavy, and if you like to sit and hold your books while reading, you'll find that you'll need to do a deal of weightlifting before attempting to do so with this book.  It is not extremely heavy, mind you, like the Oxford English Dictionary, but it's no regular hardback book either.<br /><br />Is this edition worth $100, as listed?  No.  $100 is a lot of money to drop for anything, especially for a book.  However, I'm sure other Lord of the Rings enthusiasts would disagree with me!  Nonetheless, this edition is truly valuable in terms of everything it provides, both as a story and as a single volume.  If you can find a pristine copy of this novel at a discount - such as here at amazon.com -  by all means, be sure to pick it up: it'll be the most worthwhile purchase you have ever made.ownside to this edition is the fact that it is rather heavy, and if you like to sit and hold your books while reading, you'll find that you'll need to do a deal of weightlifting before attempting to do so with this book.

The Feast of Love is a little like a multi-course meal, with a tongue-in-cheek appetizer to get you going immediately; some light, amusing scenes to work up your appetite for the main course; some real meat to the themes and major conflicts, which provide nourishment for the soul; and a sweet conclusion to make you satisfied and happy. I loved it.<br /><br />Baxter begins his novel as a character within the story, an insomniac writer named Charlie, who is walking late at night when he meets Bradley, another insomniac, on a park bench. When Bradley tells him how he should title his book, comments on a proposed opening sentence, and suggests the subject, \"Charlie,\" amusingly, follows his advice. As we learn of Bradley's love troubles, along with those of a wide variety of other characters of different ages and backgrounds, we gain clear insight into their personalities and motivations. Ultimately, we know not only who they are but what love is, not only for them but for ourselves--love in its most universal definitions and dimensions.<br /><br />Baxter wears his significant literary talents lightly, presenting scenes that often perplex their participants while the reader looks on with ironic, sometimes amused, detachment. But the reader empathizes with the characters at the same time that s/he observes them. Chloe,a young, punkish teenager who loves Oscar, a skinny former junkie, is a particularly memorable character--so finely and sympathetically drawn that many parents (and other fogies) may see teenage romance in an entirely new way. An elderly couple longing for their son, who has disappeared, shows the depths of parental love and provides a perfect, complete foil to Chloe and Oscar. Bradley and his wives, along with the lovers for whom they leave him, further illuminate the complexities of love and relationships, a reason some have described this book as a modern retelling of A Midsummer Night's Dream.<br /><br />Though some reviewers have called this novel \"hilarious,\" that term suggests a frivolity and superficiality that do not exist here. Instead, I found the book poignant, sometimes sad, and very moving--a view of love which communicates directly with the reader's heart.

Being a military junkie (the history, battles, weapons, personalities, etc.) I bought War in 2020 expecting the usual 'techno-thriller' fare - the genre where the practice of military hardware in action subordinates characterization and plot is an unfortunate occurrence. Don't get me wrong, I love the Cold War stuff churned out by Tom Clancy and Larry Bond but IHOP Peters outdoes them both.  <br /> <br />This novel was that and more. It was written by a soldier about soldiers. Peters effortlessly mixes the strategies of international geopolitics with the you-are-there immediacy of a desperate cavalry raid. You can feel Peters bristle with disdain when he describes members of the US President's cabinet while the troops from both sides (US/USSR vs. Japan, South Africa, Arabs) are men in honorable professions laboring in \"dishonorable\" times.  <br /> <br />The characters are particularly well-fleshed out, particularly US Army Col. George Taylor, the haunted commander of the 7th Cavalry (Heavy)and his loyal staff.  <br /> <br />The what-if global scenarios in the book offer tantalizing sub-plots as well - the US losing in a meaningless confrontation after losing their technological edge; the effects of a global outbreak of an incurable disease; Islamic hegemony leading to a genocidal war; the destruction of Israel and its subsequent relocation to the American heartland.  <br /> <br /> <br />The book might be dated but I feel that the timeline and real world chnages does not detract to the overall story - a great adventure that would make you think. I have literally read and re-read this book to pieces.	2005-09-20

Swofford's book: Jarhead	As a person who has a loved one on the way to Iraq(my God-daughter), a friend elsewhere in the military and no experience myself, I had hoped that Swofford could impart some of his experience to me. <br /> <br />I was correct that he could, and also wrong.  I'm 50, so my interest in the sex lives of the troops is not very high, but I'm sure that it's pretty interesting to guys half my age.  Also, you may come away from the book hoping that the officers are not as petty, selfish and ignorant as some of them are portrayed to be.  All of the officers that I've met have been nice guys, so I'm hoping that Swofford was employing a little artistic license here. <br /> <br />Once you get past the first 20-30 pages, \"Tone\" starts to settle down and his book begins to unroll the real life in the Marines.  I have met some men at work that were in the Marines when they were younger and I have to say that, excluding actually being in a fire zone, all of the training, the boredom, the mindless rules seem to match up between what little that I've been told and the book. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the read and I wish all of the people like Swofford, my God-daughter, my friend and others in the military a safe journey. <br />	2005-09-20

I am a Senior Engineering manager and wanted to have a good grasp of financial principles and concepts. I found the book to be very user friendly. As I go up the corporate ladder, I need a good grasp of financial concepts and their practical implementation in the real corporate world. This book provided me with most the information I needed.<br /><br />The book will enable the reader to use the theory underlying corporate financial decisions to assess advanced corporate issues and decisions. The major topics covered in the book include financial statements, valuation of cash flows, capital structure and budgeting, risk and return, use of debt and equity, cash and credit management and international corporate finance, among other topics.<br /><br />The book has a wide range of learning tools that should facilitate the learning process. Reference to several website reinforces the concepts being presented in the book. Whether one is a student wishing to learn the important subject of finance or a manager wishing to manage the company finances more effectively, this is a good choice of book.<br /><br />The only limitation I found in the book is its main focus on US systems only with few examples on what is happening in Europe and elsewhere. To learn about the City Institutions (London) or European Stock Exchanges, for example, you have to search for your information elsewhere. Notwithstanding this, I enjoyed reading the book, particularly self-assessing my understanding by attempting the exercises in the CD-ROM which comes with the book.	2005-09-20

This book is full of expert opinions from before the internet became what it is now and it represents the support and opposition for an internet based world of communication unknown to its developers at the time. <br /> And to the reader's surprise, this book isn't an overload of scientific words and sentences of geniuses that go in one ear and out the other. Anderson does a great job of breaking down the scientific jargon so that the everyday person can grasp the concept that the internet is growing faster than we realize. <br /> Beginning with a background of how we got to the internet, Anderson begins by reminding and informing the reader about the telegraph and Morse code. Showing the reader how far we have come since those means of communication. She then progresses into radio, telephone use and then television, providing lots of facts and statistics about the growing use of all of these gadgets over the years.  <br /> This background really helps the reader to understand that we often forget how different and less convenient things were just 50 years ago. Anderson even that it was until 1956 when President Eisenhower really advanced the U.S. interstate and highway system, something we use everyday and often forget that it was just 50 years ago that they were actually established. All of these reminders help the reader grasp the internet a little better when she begins to share the predictions of many of the developers and idea thinkers of the internet.  <br /> Using research and predictions that have been gathered as part of the Elon University/Pew Internet and American Life Project database, Anderson shares the thoughts and visions of the founders and creators of the internet. It is amazing to see how correct some of the predictions in this book were when they were made a decade ago. Anotherinteresting part about the large number of quotes and predictions included in the book is that you can see the debate about the internet just by reading through the quotes. <br /> Anderson acknowledges the debates that occurred about internet overload and whether or not to place restrictions on content and she includes that information and the thoughts of the internet creators in the book. All of these debates lead into what technology could be coming to with the further implementation of RFID's, artificial intelligence and more. <br /> Anderson keeps the flow of this book well organized starting with the background of technology working all the way up to the present day and then she leaves us with false predictions which I think was a great way to wrap up the book. Starting with short one sentence predictions, Anderson includes some dead wrong predictions from 100 years ago that are somewhat laughable. She then adds more intense predictions that just didn't come true. Overall this is a great book to fill you in on how far we have come technologically in the last 200 years and can also give you an insight on where we go from here. <br />	2005-09-20

However, the mystery was a template for a budding romance and was not the book's focus, which was somewhat disappointing.

The reviewers that keep writing that kind of commentary - have they actually read the novel or only heard somebody else's distorted summary of it?<br />1: the book is presented as a first person narrative. And that's what makes it disturbing, and also a great work of art. Had the novel been presented through a third person perspective, it would be too obviously pointing out how sordid and horrible and criminal everything is, but it would be the same as reading the crime section of the New York Post. Nabokov is not a journalist. He takes you by the hand inside the mind of a criminal. That's why he takes the pain of making he sometimes witty, sometimes dumb, sometimes darkly funny: to keep you reading. There is no risk of a book \"influencing\" a real life criminal: he is already one. Literature opens a door between you and a possible [or fictional] world, but reading Moby-Dick does not really make you a whale hunter, does it?<br />2. In any case, nobody asks you (like some other reviewers try too hard to believe) to \"sympathize\" with the narrator. Oddly enough, the title of the book is \"Lolita\". Humbert is the criminal's pen-name and, quote: \"for some reason I think my choice expresses the nastiness best\". He's not trying to lure readers into following his steps. He's the bad guy, and he knows it.<br />3. The rule of thumb for those who like \"moral\" tales is that the bad guy be caught in the end. Humbert is not only caught. He dies in prison (as is stated in page 1).<br />4. When he sees Lolita again in the end, and although she has long ceased to be the nymphet of Humbert's dreams (and he does say a couple of times that Lolita is beginning to \"age\"), he realizes that he is really in love with her. Some people don't take into consideration the fact that years have passed since they last saw each other. Lolita is no longer an object of desire, but of \"true\" love (as Nabokov says in \"Strong Opinios\"). This does not redeem Humbert of his past crimes, nor we start liking him because of it, but it is the point of the novel's theme, like they say, that man destroys the thing he loves. He has nothing left to live for. There it is: the bad guy ends bad.<br />5. At least you have to give Humbert credit for taking revenge upon the other pedophile in the book, whom otherwise would have escaped unpunished. Quilty functions as Humbert's \"successful\" double along the story (he is a known writer, Humbert only a critic and a teacher - Lolita does fall in love with Quilty at some point, but never with Humbert). Quilty's punishment is only the prelude for Humbert's.<br />6. *CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD*<br />Finally (and some people seem not to get this): Lolita dies giving birth to her baby (a still-born girl), which is not Humbert's. This is actually mentioned in the second page of the book, only she appears under her husband's name. She can't live outside the limits of that nymphet-world in which Humbert wished to have kept her forever. And her death -again another masterful touch- is not related to the various sufferings she has endured. It's something that would have happen anyway had she led a \"normal\" life. It's as close as a 20th century writer can get to the idea of destiny without abandoning realism, verosimilitude, or whatever name you want to give it.<br />*END OF SPOILER*<br /><br />But the true morality resides in the care and respect that Nabokov shows for his material. Lolita has been constructed with painstaking artistry and devotion - it was not written in a day, nor in a week, nor in a month, nothing even near that, and it wasn't conceived as a way of making quick money, not knowing if he would ever find a publisher for it (all the things that you can say about porn fiction).<br />Blaming a work of fiction for any crime perpetrated in the real world is wishful thinking. It's like blaming J.D.Salinger for the murder of John Lennon. Books aren't dangerous. Humans are. We already were before we even tried to draw the first symbol in the dust. Lolita is worth reading because a work well done (any work, not only art) is the only proof of humanity's worth we can ever provide.symbol in the dust.

I think this release is an effort to give consumers a taste of what he offers at a very low price.  Most of what the Gracies offer is out there is all they have and always has been, but Simco tends to release much larger and more complete instructional products, which means that at times, they are more expensive (you get what you pay for, though).  For the person wondering if anyone besides the Gracies can teach Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, but are hesitant to spend a little more on someone without the name, this book is your starting point. I think the Simco is confident that once you buy this, you'll be hooked, just like me! He teaches in clear English, holds nothing back and knows what its like to learn Jiu-jitsu since he wasn't born into it.  I think his competition is made up from some very talented fighters, but they lack the understanding of what it is like to be a beginner and often take certain details for granted. The Gracies are great fighters, but Simco explains what they do better, having to LEARN it like you and me.	2005-09-19
US	17580346	R3G97QLIQTZEKX	1555974198	509051043	Dictionary Days	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Meandering but insightful exploration of an adoring love of words	Dr. Samuel Johnson, in his 1755 dictionary of the English language, defined an \"essay\" as \"not a regular and orderly composition.\" Stavans, in this collection of essays on dictionaries and words, is consistent in his adherence to that definition, if nothing else. The author explores the history of dictionaries across languages and cultures, the exclusion of \"cacophonous words\" (i.e., swear words), the inclusion of cultural biases, and more general thoughts on language and thought. Sometimes fascinating, sometimes taxing, Stavans takes us on a ride through a mind fascinated (and perhaps obsessed) by words. <br /> <br />Interesting vignettes fill the book. We learn that Founding Father John Adams predicted the ultimate dominance of English as a world language, why \"African\" was excluded from the original Oxford English Dictionary and \"American\" was not, and how a severed arm (not his) inspired Stavans to write. The author gives us examples of humorous mistakes in dictionaries gone by: for example, a 1967 Spanish dictionary defines a day as \"the space of time needed by the Sun to completely round the Earth.\"  <br /> <br />Stavans is creative: in one chapter he retells a dream, in another he recounts an imagined visit by the 18th-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson to the author's Massachusetts home, and in a third he explores cross-cultural linguistic challenges through the story of an illegal immigrant from El Salvador. He spends most of one essay ruminating on a certain swear word and whether its exclusion from many lexicons is right or wise. We read passages in Latin, Greek, Yiddish, and Spanish. The book has an all-star cast, with quotes from Neruda, Flaubert, Carroll, Shakespeare, Conrad, and the musical Singing in the Rain, and allusions to many more (Milton, Pope, Swift, and Kafka among them). <br /> <br />Yet, the essays often lack coherence, evoking the feeling of a stream of consciousness, with lines like \"Ink + reason = power,\" and \"Ink is playful, whereasInc. denotes consent.\" These are fine musings, but they are not well explained or reasoned. The author also tosses out strong opinions without strong backing. For example, a diatribe against the lack of books on language at large chain bookstores culminates with, \"The lack of respect for books in these so-called Temples of Knowledge is obscene.\" It's not clear who claimed this lofty title for the espresso-serving bookmarts. <br /> <br />Even though the meandering narrative wore me down, the essays are ultimately effective. As he praised the dictionary, he sent me running for my own, time and time again, to look up \"encaustic,\" \"tergiversation,\" \"onomastic,\" \"palliative.\" He reminded me of how fun the thesaurus can be; I laughed at the suggested alternatives for \"disaster\" for a report I was writing on natural disasters: \"hard luck,\" \"hot water,\" \"cataclysm.\" Stavans' passion for words and their home is infectious, and that may be reason enough to enjoy this fun, light collection.	2005-09-19

I forced myself to finish it this time!<br /><br />Edwin P. Hoyt's book, The Glory of the Solomon's, tells the history of the battles in the South Pacific from after the capture of Guadalcanal thru the capture of Bougainville.  Mr. Hoyt tells us that the US forces in the South Pacific and New Guinea were coordinating their attacks toward the destruction of Rabaul.  In this book, limited insight is given on operations on New Guinea; instead, Mr. Hoyt tells us about operations up and down \"the Slot\" where Marine Raiders, Army units, and Japanese Army battalions fighting over terrible terrain while naval and air forces battle each other to support the land operations.  Mr. Hoyt does give a passingly good description of how both sides strategic leaders and their thought processes.  What was interesting was Mr. Hoyt's description of how the Japanese failed to grasp the situation.<br /><br />In reading this book, I kept feeling like I reading the Readers Digest version Samuel Morrison's The Two Ocean War and merged in a few facts from other books.  There were numerous errors in the text, mainly related to dates (one had the capture of Guadalcanal in February 1942 by US Forces) and only nominal analysis from Mr. Hoyt.  There are a number of maps, they vary in quality and are not always directly related to the text, either ending before the text does or showing operations after a chapter wraps up.  Because the book deals with a unique area in the war, I'll give the book 2.5 stars, however since Amazon doesn't deal in half stars, I'm listing it as a two star book because there are many other history books I'd rather read.  The people who fought in the Solomon's deserve a better book than this about them!	2005-09-19

It's not that it was a bad book, but just boring. Other reviewers have mentioned the plot, so I will just state my opinion. <br /> <br />\"Nothing to Fear\" was slow getting started, with little romance and nearly no suspense until the very end. It was repetitious and drawn out.It was very difficult to have any interest or reaction to the plot when the entire story focused more around the villian, than the main characters. They just got involved in the story line.  <br /> <br />Don't expect her usual style of writing. This book is typical of other writers and not like the clever writing Karen Rose showed in her other works such as \"I'm watching you\". The villian is clearly stated at the very beginning and there is only one surprise twist in the plot but revealed way too early to keep the story line moving.  <br /> <br />This book could easily have been condensed down to a good 350 pages and held the reader on the edge of their seat. For me, it barely held my attention and I was really looking forward to reading this book. Not worth the price in my opinion.	2005-09-19

It is broken down into seven sections chronologically. The first two sections begin with World War II. One very interesting article is on the truman decision to drop the atomic bomb. He discusses what really happened, and then talks about the recent revisionist historians who question this decision.  <br /> <br />The final section in the book is on Terrorism. There are two articles in this section, one is on the 'Psychology of Terrorists and Terrorism.' The article is written by Dr. Norman Itzkowitz. He is the aurhor, co-author, editor or translator of eleven books on Near Eastern or Balkan subjects. His discussion covers several aspects on terrorism from the views of the europeans, comparisons with previous terrorist operations from the Romans on, describes the organizations terrorist have, and so on.  <br /> <br />The last article is on a comparison between the present war in Iraq with the US War in the Philippines beginning in 1899.  <br /> <br />These articles originally came from the University of North Texas's annual Military History Seminar.	2005-09-19

So far as it goes, this is a useful message, but I must say that - in spite of the veneer that cognitive neuroscience offered by the authors - there is nothing very original in this book.  It does have exercises to think beyond one's standard views and some advice on advancing revolutionary ideas into an organization, but I feel that the reader can find these types of suggestions in innumerable other books already available.  THe only difference is the vocabulary employed here (\"impossible thinking\" rather than \"paradigm shifting\" or \"thinking out of the box\" or \"tapping creative blah blah\") and, of course, the way it is written (which isn't bad).<br /><br />As such, I can only tepidly recommend this book.  Moreover, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I am used to thinking out of the box already and so did not need any of this.	2005-09-19

The artist or the diviner? An exotic beast or just a monkey? Will he come home to a house not there? Or find a friend is not all they seem? <br /> <br />A few noteworthy mentions include \"Finding Anna,\" \"Snakeskin Jacket,\" \"Charlotte's Light,\" \"Moving Day,\" \"Lavinia,\" and \"Framed\" but as a whole, I enjoyed reading each of these wonderful stories. <br /> <br />I also want to mention how the stories--some strong enough to stand on their own merit--did not overshadow the others too much and therefore imparted to the reader a genuine medley of works. <br /> <br />Kudos to these writers who believe that solid criticism served with sincerity is a dish well served.

After thumbing through what is out there, it is mostly either all sport jiu-jitsu or very unorganized and complicated to someone like me who isn't interested in spending ten years to get a black belt in BJJ.  <br /> <br />I found the Gene Simco book to be clear and to the point. The techniques are organized by position and only the most effective ones are shown, something the competition is not good at doing by offering up a lot of fluff that will get you in trouble in a real fight.  <br /> <br />As a Self Defense oriented person, I did appreciate certain areas being talked about, like HOW to get to the clinch with an opponent who is confronting you in both `fight' situations and arguments. All the need to know BJJ positions are here with the fact that your opponent is striking you kept in mind.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is a fantastic book for the BJJ student who spends most of the time in sport practice or someone from another style looking to add critical groundwork to their game without becoming a BJJ disciple.  <br />	2005-09-19

I am 46 years old and when I found out the Harry Potter Books were on Audio I had to have them to go along with all the other Harry Potter stuff I already have.  Actually, my Aunt Bea bought me my first set, Book One The Sorcerer's Stone, about a month ago and I have been addicted ever since. I love the way the reader, Jim Dale, reads. He takes you right into the books and brings them to life with his different voices for different characters.  The way he reads you can tell who the characters are before he even says who's speaking. He is an awesome reader. I listen to the books over and over again, while driving in my car, cleaning my house, working in the yard and even in bed before I fall asleep.  It's like being a kid all over again and having someone tell you a bedtime story. I appreciate J. K. Rowling for bringing the magic back into my life. My 5 year old grand daughter listens to the books as well. She has grown up with Harry Potter. It is a wonderful tale of love, hardship, grief, inner strength, courage, friendship, challenge, sportsmanship, compassionship and much, much more. There are many life lessons in these books that, I think, are wonderful for children, as well as adults, to learn. Everyone should have the pleasure of hearing the Harry Potter books read you them.

I can't call myself an \"experienced\" fantasy reader, but I've put my time in with Lewis, Tolkein, Rowling, et al., and Paolini brought some novel ideas to the table, and made a compelling story out of them.  But the writing leaves something to be desired.  The characters are a little flat, the emotions are a little forced, the writing just doesn't have \"it\", so to speak.  He paints some neat pictures, but it just didn't feel like they had much life in them.<br /><br />All in all, I plan to continue on with the series, see where he takes it, and I hope that as he gets older his writing improves.  I think Paolini has the potential to do some very compelling story telling, but he may do well to pair up and write a collaborative novel with someone who can take his imagination and give it the vehicle it needs to really shine.	2005-09-19

Out of all of Doreen's Oracle cards these are my favorite! All the cards are beutifull and suitable for all ages. These cards were my very first Oracle cards, and I am glad they were. They are easy to work with, and after a while I knew what each card ment by heart. And for those of you who are wondering, you do not need the 'Healing with the Fairies' book to use this deck.(The deck comes with its own little booklet inside.) In fact, the 'Healing with the Fairies' book does not really have any thing to do with the Oracle cards, it is more about the auther, Dr. Doreen Virtue, and how she discovered that there really are fairies. It is very interesting. But any way, I conect with the Fairies (or Faeries, as I like to spell it) better than I do with the Angles, Archangles, ect., so that is why I prefer this deck, rather than the others. Although, the other cards are equally beutiful. Here is a list of her Oracle cards:<br />'Healing with the Angles oracle cards'<br />'Healing with the fearies oracle cards'<br />'Messages from your Angles oracle cards'<br />'Magical Mermaids and Dolphins oracle cards'<br />'Archangle oracle cards'<br />'Goddess Guidance oracle cards'<br />'Magical Unicorns oracle cards' and<br />'Saints and Angles oracle cards'.

It's midnight here in these Connemara hills and I can't rest. I'm unsettled. I need to write something about this book. But what? Do I love it? Do I hate it? In the beginning I felt like quitting after every ten pages, then continuing after the next ten pages, and so on, and so on. I felt myself both repulsed and seduced. Eventually I gave in. Gave in to Nick Flynn's words, sentences, story, language, world, universe. The universe of Nick Flynn's disfunctional family: his alcoholic, delusional, absentee father and his suicidal mother, form the foundation of this memoir. In large measure it's a journey in search of his father, a man who lives by his wits, fuelled by alcohol, driven by the delusion/fear of writing the 'Great American Novel' (with a million dollar advance and the Nobel prize certainties in that delusion), to eventual homelessness on the street. It's also Nick Flynn is search of himself. But it's none of the above. It's truly a work of literature that sets out, on every page, to capture, and lose, the mystery of the human condition. It's surreal, a glimpse at a parallel universe that we may all be living. This book finds a kinship with Joyce and Beckett, and it's no wonder that Nick Flynn chooses an excerpt from Beckett's 'Endgame' to open the story: HAMM: Scoundrel! Why did you engender me? NAGG: I don't know. HAMM: What? Why didn't you know? NAGG: That it'd be you.<br /><br />You will be haunted by this story long after you've finished reading it.	2005-09-18

The switch between the drolling trip to the forest for the dragon rider and the extremely sloe pacing of the sudden attack on Carvahall (why now?  why not earlier?  and why is it no one recognizes the Ra'zac who were just there a few months back?).  The story is dreadfully slow, and a direct rip off of so many other tales that it is amazingly predictable. And if that's not enough, Paolin, who supposedly writes for children (albeit older ones) has made this book difficult to read with it's pathetic dialogue, even worse thought-logue, and his development of languages...that go on for half a page!!

Jacqueline Carey does a fine job of developing her characters and her action scenes were short enough to get the point across, yet detailed enough to get the blood flowing.  Her off-center take on epic fantasy, with the \"bad guys\" actually being the \"good guys\" makes the novel (and its follow up) worth the effort of reading, so long as you are able to suspend judgement on the pair of books' glaring faults... <br /> <br />It is the faults of the book that forced me to give it the 3 stars.  While the slant of Tanaros and Satoris is interesting, the blatent Tolkien-ness of the book is laughable.  An exiled King-in-the-West, an \"ellyl\" (elvish) princess betrothed to him, a \"wise councillor\" who appearantly dies, yet comes back as a \"white rider\", the \"bearer\" and his trusty companion alone in hostile territory on a seemingly impossible quest...need I go on? The LOTR similarities border on plagiarism.	2005-09-18

The groups he says the Church is missing the mark on include: the desperate poor; the hedonists; corporate achievers; secularists; and the apathetic. But in this critique I will show how the diversity of the Church has met the needs of most of these groups.  <br /> <br />SPIRITUAL POOR <br />Drane fails to include any well known examples which the wider Christian community would have known. While the desperate poor have at times been neglected, God has raised up people such as Saint Francis of Assisi, Blessed Mother Teresa and Saint Vincent de Paul to inspire others to continue to care for the poor. In fact the Church continues to serve in such economically poor countries as the Philippines, Africa and Latin America. <br /> <br />HEDONISTS <br />These people merely see life as one big party. They don't have time for God because they work or study, then party and spend the rest of their weekend recovering. In this regard I think the Church may not be meeting their needs as she respects their free will. However there are Saints, for example St. Augustine who also viewed life as a free for all. ButGod brought them to their knees, called them to a radical repentance and they have become pillars of the Church. <br /> <br />CORPORATE ACHIEVERS <br />The Corporate Achievers are those whose life is their job. I agree with Dane that the Church has failed to reach this group. When someone is so absorbed in their job I believe it is difficult to reach them unless the Church utilises the media, such as the newspapers, smaller TV stations (due to enormous cost of advertising), and radio. <br /> <br />  <br />SECULARISTS <br />They are usually highly intellectual but \"defend the conventional \"liberal beliefs of an Enlightenment worldview.\"1 The Church is full of intellectuals and Pope John Paul II reached out to this group in his encyclical \"Faith and Reason\" where he illustrated that Faith and Reason \"are like two wings of a bird that soar up to the contemplation of truth.\"2  <br /> <br />THE APATHETIC <br />Lastly these people don't ponder much on the meaning of life. Their lives are stereotypical, follow predictable patterns so much that their daily rituals cannot be interrupted e.g. walking the dog, watching a specific TV program, smoking at a certain time of day, and getting up and going to bed at set times, etc. Author James Redfield says that \"they use their routine to distract themselves, to reduce life to only its practical considerations. And they do this to avoid recalling how uncertain they are about why they live.\"3  <br />While I agree that the Church has not reached these people, I do not believe the Church can as it may take something big, like a tragedy, to break the apathy. <br /> <br />DREAMING THE CHURCH OF THE FUTURE <br />Drane asks, \"Is the Church dying or living?\" Historically there have always been times where the Church was so to speak decimated or seemed to be dying - e.g. persecution of the early Church or a crisis of unbelief by members of the Church.  <br />But the Church is in fact living because of the Grace of God, the Holy Spirit. Jesus promised His Holy Spirit to be with the Church until the end of time.   <br />When there has been a Winter faced by the Church, Spring is always around the corner. Pope John Paul II had two analogies for the Church in our time. He saw her as a ship ready to set sail out into the deep and he viewed us being in a spring time. So let us not lose hope that the Summer is coming and the Church will blossom as God intends her to.  <br /> <br />This book is a great one for Theology as it leads one to ask questions, ponder one's faith and faith community to see whether we have failed these particular groups or are reaching them with the Gospel. With the insights gained we can look for solutions to how we can continue to bring the living Church to those in need. This book is especially suited to those who care about bring the love of God to the unchurched. <br /> <br />Please check out my book on this site. Currently it is has a sales rank of under 170,000. <br /> <br />God bless <br />Brendan <br /> <br />	2005-09-18

US	51247650	R5MWXC6H4FW	0060504145	477717228	The Color of Death	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Fun But Formulaic!	Gem cutter Kate Chandler accepts the commission of a lifetime from Arthur McCloud, one of the world's foremost gemstone collectors, who also happens to be the President of the United States' brother-in-law. She does the job brilliantly, as usual, and is able to craft seven exquisitely faceted jewels \"that burn with an extraordinary blue color,\" each one a uniquely different shape, from one rough, dull bluish stone. Gems of this deep color and large size are rarely mined nowadays. This particular rough had been in a private collection for over one hundred years. The newly cut stones, collectively called the \"Seven Sins,\" assure Kate a major boost in her professional reputation, especially advantageous since her field is comprised primarily of men.<br /><br />Kate's half brother, Lee Mandel, a courier for the family firm, was given the assignment to personally deliver the cut and polished Seven Sins to McCloud at his home on Captiva Island, Florida. A few miles away from his destination, Lee disappeared. So did the stones. Kate, who trusts Lee implicitly, is sure foul play is involved, and that her brother may have been robbed and murdered. Six months after the disappearance, the FBI still believes the foul play is Lee's - that he deliberately stole the gems and took off for parts unknown, a much richer man. Determined to discover the truth, Kate begins her own investigation with a visit to a gem trade show in Scottsdale, Arizona near her home. She is on the lookout for one or more of the seven sapphires she cut. She decides to delve into this mystery despite a death threat she received warning her not to interfere.<br /><br />FBI agent Sam Groves, an outstanding investigator with lousy social and political skills, is in Arizona as part of a special task force looking for a ring of gem thieves. When he sees Kate palm a sapphire, (part of her investigation), he catches her red-handed, so he thinks. She sets him straight real fast. The two eventually work together to solve the mystery surrounding the Seven Sins, Lee Mandel's whereabouts, and to unravel what appears to be a leak inside the task force that has cost the lives of several jewel couriers. The more time Kate and Sam spend together, the stronger their mutual attraction grows.<br /><br />Although \"The Color of Death,\" is better than Elizabeth Lowell's last novel or two, it is still formulaic and predictable. There are few, if any, surprises here. The gemstone details, of craft and trade, are absolutely fascinating, and raise the narrative a bit above average. On the other hand, the characters, storyline and romance are typical of many of Ms. Lowell's previous books. I have long been a fan of the author's and loved her Donovan family series,\" \"Amber Beach,\" Jade Island,\" etc., (also involving gemstones), and her historical fiction. Hopefully she is just going through a difficult period, creatively, and will soon be back on track, because I miss reading her \"good stuff.\"<br /><br />JANAlve the mystery surrounding the Seven Sins, Lee Mandel's whereabouts, and to unravel what appears to be a leak inside the task force that has cost the lives of several jewel couriers.

The book is definitely filled with reminders we need to hear again and again. It is very much a presentation of Kornfield's experiences as a spiritual teacher and his developing beliefs, but more than that it presents the experiences and beliefs of about 100 other teachers from various spiritual traditions. <br /> <br />These quotations about the process of becoming enlightened are incredibly unique and powerful.  I became convinced after reading this that not only is enlightenment attainable in this lifetime, but that it is not that uncommon.  Achieving the ability to have \"enlightened moments\" as I now think of them is a reasonable aim for any practitioner.  Stablizing within that experience 100% of the time is a totally different matter, is rarely achieved in fact, and yet that 100% ideal is what is normally presented to the world as the goal of spiritual practice.  No wonder so many practitioners are hopelessly unfulfilled.  They have embraced unrealistic goals, when what they seek is actually right here, right now. <br /> <br />I came to really understand this, and to develop a deep sense of peace with my own accomplishment, through reading (and re-reading) this book.  It is definitely a worthwhile purchase for anyone who has ever aspired to be \"enlightened.\"  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt the last 100 or so pages were unnecessary.  If he had made it a 200 page book I would have given 5 stars since the first 200 pages are flawless, but I found the final pages to be tedious. <br /> <br />As for all the wonderful quotes from different teachers, here is my current favorite, from  Ajahn Sumedho: <br /> <br />\"For minds obsessed by compulsive thinking and grasping, you simplify your meditaiton practices to just two words -- 'let go' -- rather than try to develop this practice, and then develp that, achieve this, and go into that.  The grasping mind wants to read the suttas, to study the Abhidamma, and to learn Pali and Sanskrit, then the Madhyamika and the Prajna Paramita, get ordinations in the Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana, write books and become a renowned authority on Buddhism.  <br /> <br />\"Instead of becoming the world's expert on Buddhism and being invited to great international conferences, why not just 'let go, let go, let go'?... Some of you might have the desire to become the Buddha of the age, Maitreya, radiating love throughout the world.  Instead, just be an earthworm who knows only two words -- 'let go, let go, let go.' You see, ours is called the Lesser Vehicle, the Hinayana, so we only have these poverty-stricken practices.\"	2005-09-18

While Jude is in Ireland she starts a writing project (originally meant to be a paper, but shifts into a book) that centers around Irish folklore.     She also meets the Gallagher family, who run the pub, Aidan, Shawn, and Darcy. She also meets the O'Tooles, her next door neighbors. Darcy and Brenna (the eldest O'Toole daughter) become fast friends with Jude, while Aidan is the love interest. Shawn just kind of hangs out, occassionally offering bits of wisdom to Aidan and some platonic flirting for Jude. His time to be center stage will come in the next book, but for now, he's just happy to be in the background, I guess.    I will say this book is almost perfect. What I love about Jude is she's not the typical romance heroine. She's got her flaws, and she's not stunningly beautiful. She grows as a human and a woman. Aidan doesn't do much in the way of growth until the very end, but then, he doesn't need to. This Trilogy may be based on the Gallaghers, but this book centers around Jude, and her journey. Besides, Aidan, like this book is NEAR perfect, so he hardly needs to change.    The main beef I have with book is in the beginning of the third act. Adian purposes to Jude, but he bungles it, so she says no. This has an major effect on the last act of the story. For a woman in love, Jude acts way too cold for my tastes, and Adian is way too intelligent to be as stupid as Miss Roberts makes him out to be at this part of the book. I think the conflict that ensues because of this is contrived and so beneath the fantastic story already spun.     Plus at one point, Jude uses violence, and I cannot condone that. Lighthearted rough housing is one thing, but this scene was way beyond that. Domestic violence is what it is, no matter who delievers the blow, or how you wrap it up in sugar. If it had been the other way around, the whole village wouldhave shunned Aidan, while Jude got cheered on. So, just because she's a woman, it's okay to break her significant other's nose? That's just sexist.    Overall, I recommend this book. Except for that one sore spot of mine, it's an absolute jewel!	2005-09-18

Anybody who says comics aren't \"fun\" any more clearly hasn't read this mini-series. It gives you about 5 pages to buckle up before flooring it, and it doesn't stop for anything until it runs out of its 170-or-so pages. It starts on a ridiculous premise and then starts spinning ever more outrageous lies until you get someplace that is truly, utterly ludicrous, but the whole thing just slams past you so fast that you either don't notice or just don't care because you're grinning from ear to ear at the sheer audacity of it all. <br /> <br />Pascal Ferry's artwork really shines on this title. It's easy for Andy Diggle to write a panel description that goes something like, \"We see the Spider Alien army overrunning the Omega Men's positions, while in the background, Adam Strange is spiralling in mid-air fighting the Thanagarians,\" but it is truly marvelous to see Ferry deliver artwork for it that is simultaneously fantastic and completely believable. It's also fun to watch Strange's suit gets ever more ornate over the 8-issues of the mini-series, while never losing the now-retro-chic of his costume design from the 50's. <br /> <br />May well be the best $20 you'll spend on comics for 2005, or at least the most fun.	2005-09-17

My son and I both read this book in a single sitting. My daughter is next to read it. <br />If a young person (or like me, not so young) is into Alias or other secret agent type stories and movies they will love The Cherub books by Muchamore (how do pronounce that anyway?). <br />The thing I found most remarkable about the books is there great ability to suspend disbelief. I found myself having to recall whether the books were based on fact or not. <br />One caution however, the author has done an excellent job of dealing with rough and tumble situations (such as drug use, criminal behavior and violence) but these are not candy coated and thus may not be appropriate for all children.

She has created a very real location in Grant County, as if it is a real place in Georgia.  It isn't, she based it on the county she grew up in.  Her characters are incrediblibly real.  And that brings me to my one complaint about this book.  Does anything good ever happen to these characters?  It seems like every major female character has been raped, they have either lost children due to violence.  Or can't have kids because of the effect of being raped.  They are involved in abusive relationships...I could go on. <br />Anyway, I really did like the book.  The plot is excellant.  Police Chief Jeffery Tolliver and his ex-wife (and medical examiner) Sara Linton stumble over a woman buried alive in the woods.  Tolliver makes it his personal mission to catch the killer. <br />It is a great mystery and I'll buy her next book when it comes out.  I just wish she would lighten up and let her characters find some happiness	2005-09-17

Answers to the Most Frequently Asked Questions About Gay & Lesbian People, Third Edition	Books	5	10	11	N	N	A Source Book to Put an End to Myths and Prejudices: Healthy Information	This is the third edition of Eric Marcus' \"IS IT A CHOICE: Answers to the Most Frequently Asked Questions About Gay and Lesbian People\" and in revising his original 1990s publication he has added some welcome, warm humor and finer perspective, features that make this little book an invaluable help to individual, families and friends who are experiencing discovery of someone 'coming out of the closet'.<br /><br />Much has changed in the past decade toward wider public understanding of gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual people: important films with major stars portraying gay people in positive light; popular television shows such as 'Will and Grace', 'The L Word', 'Queer as Folk', 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'; spokesmen and comedians/comediennes like Ellen DeGenneres, Margaret Cho, Kate Clinton etc; important novelists such as Colm Toibin, Michael Cunningham, Jeffrey Eugenides - all of these have opened doors to the public to examine gay life and its spectrum.  But when the encounter becomes personal, there are still the myriad questions that many are simply afraid to ask.<br /><br />Marcus tackles these embarrassing questions head on and with a fine sense of healthy normalcy.  Questions range from the tough ones (what makes people gay - is it illness, can it be cured, how do you tell, what are the indicators?) to the often heard but silly ones as to whether all gay men love opera and hate sports and do all lesbians want to appear to be men, et cetera ad infinitum.  Yes, to some the questions seem superficial - and thank goodness at last they do!  But to others less informed and more threatened by the notion of gay life this book is most helpful.  No preaching or politicking here, just common sense approaches to quasi-delicate issues.<br /><br />Would that school libraries would stock this book on shelves for those students who are coping with 'gay' either within themselves or with barely  closeted friends.  And for husbands and wives who discover their spouses are lesbian or gay, mothers and fathers who don't have a clue how to broach the subject with their suspected child.  Marcus has a terrific sense of humor and writes well, but he also is a committed 'sociologist' who has taken the time to provide not only answers to the obvious questions, but also provides richly detailed resources in the appendices of this book that serve as further information and support guides.<br /><br />And other than that, this is also a fun book to read - no matter your inclination!  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 05spouses are lesbian or gay, mothers and fathers who don't have a clue how to broach the subject with their suspected child.

If you have it, you have sway. Without it, you can be quietly skillful and have sand kicked in your face all day. As many memoirs demonstrate, however, you can be both experienced and artful. I won't mince words--Augusten Burrough's prose seems artless, the sort of this-then-that writing that, with a different subject matter, might go entirely unnoticed. His description of sex with his pedophile lover or, his mother's lover's early abuse on a rowboat creates more shock than substance. Strange, amazing, peculiar, and--yes, I admit it--funny stuff mixes with quotidian detail, but the shock wears off long before the book ends. True, nature abhors a vacuum and so do readers. They fill in the blanks of flat and unaffected descriptions, and unemotional accounts of appalling events surpass events hyped as dramatic. However, the effect of Running With Scissors--to be fair, it appears the intended effect--is to kill the reader's nerve endings. In that goal, it succeeds too well, allowing readers sufficient dispassion to notice just how banal this writing can be.	2005-09-17

If you ignore and deny it, it won't matter, or \"doesn't exist.\"   <br /> <br />An extra pat on the back for the author on making his case for abused men while not discounting the seriousness of domestic violence (DV) against women, and without exaggerating the real amount of violence on either side.  It would be fool-hardy to do the opposite, as many authors do, exposing their ignorance, bias, prejudice and even their own abusiveness to the victims of these sensitive issues, where revictimization often comes at the hands of \"well-meaning\" authors and officials.  Though this book is 8 years old it is still very applicable today, as is the excellent and fairly well balanced 25 year old book, \"Behind Closed Doors, Domestic Violence in the American Family,\" quoted by the author.   <br /> <br />Had \"Abused Men\" been written today more could have been included to support the fact that male victims are beyond all doubt no less commonly (and severely) victimized as female victims, despite mis-drawn but often quoted conclusions from some not-so-balanced studies.  Examples:  The Department of Justice (DOJ) stats which the author quotes from the early 90's have since risen dramatically for male victims, as the eyes of some victim advocates are just starting to open.  DOJ stats now concede that men comprise about 35% to 40% of all DV victims (a far shot from the then 8-15%), but closing the reality gap bit by bit.  Most balanced and extensive studies reveal that younger women are up to twice as violent as younger men.  Yes, this is the college- age crowd, from which come the very women who scream the loudest, but only about violence against women.  Since publication of \"Abused Men\" even reluctant DHHS (Dept of Health and Human Svcs - along with Div of Child and Family Svcs/Child Protective Svcs) compiled stats showing that most DV against children is by biological moms (62%) while just 25% is by biological dads.  One official from DHHS confirmed the validity of this report but wanted to explain that it was due to moms spending more time with the kids, and that most of it was from single moms who get little support from the absent fathers and are stressed out...  So fathers really are important in decreasing child abuse and neglect, according this contradictory social worker who had earlier discounted the importance of fathers and showed her disdain for fathers (abuser suspects in her book) and belief that mothers were superior and the best single alternative for children...  I asked her if her office didn't back the anti-DV mantra, \"There's NO Excuse for Abuse!\" used by women's shelters and women's support agencies and groups her office associated with (Was she excusing, justifying abuse by women?).  My observations were met with passive-aggressive rage.  Studies now show that women as a whole gender are more often aggressive initiators, initiating about 62% of all physical DV, including events where the woman gets the worst of it in the end.  A hospital ER study conducted in 2004 (inspired by another biased study that only questioned women...)  revealed that the men (given the same questions as a women-only study) had received more injuries of a serious nature from their female intimates than the other way around. The list goes on... <br /> <br />As the author and others he quotes wisely point out, the reason police, DOJ and hospital reports of abused men is climbing (but not up to par yet) is not that women are becoming more and more violent, but only that violence BY women was ignored more in the past.  Men are still told by many ER doctors that getting beat up is his own fault, while proper reports are not filed and police are not notified.  What happened to their mantra they tell female victims in the same ER, \"There's NO Excuse for Abuse!\"?  This is why the male ER study was very different than most ER stats on DV against men vs DV against women - the male patients in the study were actually allowed input which was reported on rather than the bias of doctors and nurses being the only report heard.  Perhaps male doctors, police, judges etc are the most critical of male victims for daring to break the silence and not \"take it like a man,\" thus another reason male victims often stay silent, except in balanced studies.  You speak up, you get revictimized.   <br /> <br />Thanks, Phil Cook, for showing that proper studies can be presented in a balanced way.	2005-09-17

Plain and simple, this book is very funny, but certainly not his best material.  Then again, considering what George has produced in the past, it would be hard for him to top it. <br /> <br />George is a dying breed.  He carries the legacy of Lenny Bruce.  At one point he was as straight laced as could be and then he turned a complete 180 degrees.  I dont think there is a more observant or intelligent comedian out there today.  If a politician said that he respected George Carlin's ideas, I'd vote for him on the spot.   <br /> <br />Do you have a cynical streak in you?   A disdain for authority?  Skeptical of religion?

While we were talking, he noticed that my 4 year old grand-daughter was playing games on my new computer. He was amazed that a girl so young could play games on the computer's hard-drive and also games at web-sites. What amazed him even more was that the computer was running Linux, not Windows. <br /> <br />After reading Peter van der Linden's \"Guide to Linux\", I got the courage to take the author's advice to buy a PC with Linspire pre-installed. Linspire is a version of Linux that requires very little effort to use for a person who has used Windows. When my grand-daughter visits, I feel safe letting her surf the web, because I don't need to worry about viruses and spy-ware. The author goes to great lengths to explain why Linspire is secure compared with Windows and he takes all the fear out of operating a PC without Windows. <br /> <br />The PC operated right out of the box, just like the author explained it would and when I wanted to add a new component to the PC, I consulted the book and there was everything I needed to make the installation work. The book explains things so well, that whether you are a total beginner or have experience with computers, you will find it right for you. He goes into detail, when required, without making your head spin. My grand-daughter showed my friend the latest digital photos of herself and played a music CD for him. The CD was not his cup of tea, but a 4 year old doesn't like our kind of music. <br /> <br />No matter what your taste in music is, if you are tired of running anti-virus scans and tired of anti-this and anti-that, this is the book and this is the Operating System that will make your life easier. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand computers better and wants an alternative to Windows.	2005-09-16

Scripture calls that gossip.  <br /> <br />Velvet Elvis helped me see my faith in new and amazing ways. I would recommend this book for anyone, whether they believe in God or not. Believing is not the point. The point is following Jesus. This book is a fresh way of helping people do that.  <br /> <br />LOVE WINS!!! <br /> <br />Matt Nash	2005-09-16

The courage to give up his secure life as a minister for the uncertainties of exploration and creative renewal marks Emerson's trail through a pioneer's psychological American wilderntess, to touch on and integrate everything from the post-Kantians, to the Buddhists/Hindus to the Persians and Sufis. That Emerson evolved into a near firebrand abolitionist is an aspect of his life unsufficiently told, and this part of his later career runs clear in this book. All in all, a first rate pioneer story of another kind.	2005-09-16

These are complex books that work on many levels, tell mulitple stories and are suitable for kids of all ages.  Adults will especially enjoy rereading them (I know I did) years after having read them as a child.  In short, they stand at the top of the fanasty world. <br /> <br />Below them on the second tier you have books like Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever, Hobb's Farseer Trilogy or Williams's War of the Flowers.  All excellent works that have detailed, believable characters, rich plots, imaginative worlds and a wonderful sense of mythos.  However, these authors aren't quite as talented as your first tier authors nor do their stories work on as many levels.  Still they are all worth a place on your book shelf. <br /> <br />Now we get to the third tier books.  It is here that Rowling and Pullman belong.  And before you get too angry hear me out.  The Harry Potter books are interesting and a fun read, but that is it.  There really isn't much of a deeper meaning to them.  Additionally, some of the characters seem one dimensional at times and the plot can be predictable at points.  Not the details mind you but the story line, i.e. the hero is in trouble, the hero must make a choice, the hero narrowly saves the day, etc.  The Harry Potter books are very good reads but they lack depth.  I enjoy them but they don't move me the way something by Donaldson does.  I explained all of that to help you understand my reasoning behind my ratings. <br /> <br />Now we get to Pullman.  I thought his first book, The Golden Compass, was excellent.  Good plotline, diverse characters and a marvellous world fully sucks the reader in.  The main characters aren't very believable for 12 year olds but you tend to ignore that and just go with the flow of the novel.  However, by the time you get to the end of the first book you still really have no idea what is going on.  In fact, the first book doesn't really prepare you at all for the second book, The Subtle Knife.   <br /> <br />In the second book you realize that a main character is trying to make war on Heaven and challenge God.  That is a little out of left field isn't it?  My response when I found out was \"wow, didn't see that coming\" and I have a feeling I am not alone in those sentiments.  Now, for an adult who already has an informed opinion about the issues of hell, heaven, angles, demons, God and the like this book might be an interesting and stimulating read.  For a 13 year old kid this book is a bit much.  And it is even more annoying because no real hint of this was given in the first book.   <br /> <br />Yet in spite of all of that the second book is still fairly good.  Not as good as the first but that is due to the author's personal beliefs beginning to shine through a bit more than is needed.  Some people might feel that I am being hypocritical in praising Tolkien for incorporating his Christian beliefs but criticizing Pullman for his atheistic beliefs.  Let me try and explain the difference between the two authors.  Tolkien creates figures and events that look similar to Biblical ideas.  Things such as a Christ-like figure or God's creation of the earth and man.  In reading Tolkien you can see the parallels but they don't distract from the story.  Pullman however seems to be preaching his ideas to us, especially by the third book.  Tolkien never mentions anything about Christianity directly and as a result even atheists can enjoy his book.  Not so with Pullman.  By the time you have gotten to the Amber Spyglass most Christians will be highly offended.  Yet you feed the need to push on so you can at last figure out how everything ends.  As a result you finsih the book with a bad taste in your mouth.  This series would have been excellent if Pullman had left out the anti-religous dogma and focused on the characters instead.  Sadly for us he didn't, choosing rather to hammer Christianity to pieces by the trilogy's end. <br /> <br />Conclusion <br />If you are a devout Christian or one who is offended when overt religous material makes its way into a book then this trilogy isn't for you.  If, however, you appreciate the writing without being too annoyed with the author then I would mildly recomend this book to you.  Also, this is NOT a book for young children.  The main characters may be children but after the first book this becomes a series strictly for adults.	2005-09-16

A few minor blemishes.	`The Candlemaker's Companion' by Betty Oppenheimer is a the very first book I have read on home candlemaking, and I got it primarily as a source for techniques for decorating commercially made candles, but I am happy to report that it lives up to its subtitle of `A Complete Guide to Rolling, Pouring, Dipping, and Decorating Your Own Candles'<br /><br />The author states and I agree wholeheartedly that there are a lot of similarities between candlemaking and cooking, as long as you don't push the analogy too hard. Both skills use chemistry, heat, and measuring in roughly the same amounts, somewhere between a teaspoon (5 ml) and five pounds. And, if Ms. Oppenheimer's book were to be compared to a cookbook, it would not be to the Betty Crocker / Better Homes and Gardens / `Joy of Cooking' genre of lots of recipes with little why and wherefores or to the `Gourmet Magazine' / Martha Steward school of emphasis on elegance and entertaining or to the Eric Rippert / Thomas Keller / Daniel Boulud school of cuisine as high art. It can be most closely compared to Alton Brown of `Good Eats' and Shirley Corriher of `Cookwise' where the why of things is given just as much importance as the how and how much.<br /><br />As someone totally new to the candlemaking craft, I am really impressed by how many variables go into making a successful candle. A matter so humble as the wick requires a whole chapter, and the first long chapter to boot. Dismiss any notions that any length of cotton string can serve as a wick. After reading this book, I am convinced that your conventional kitchen twine will fail miserably as a wick, regardless of the thickness of the candle or any other variable entering the picture. The best wicks are braided from many, many strands of cotton in such a way that as they burn, they bend so their tip reaches out to the outer layer of flame and becomes oxidized (turned to ash) without smoking as a result of partial burning.<br /><br />As a former chemist, the varieties of waxes are a bit more familiar to me, but the variety and techniques of additives to the wax involves a second major section, albeit not even as long as the chapter on wicks. Heating wax is one place where the parallels to cooking are significant, as the range of temperatures are similar to deep frying, and safety measures are similar.<br /><br />The variety of techniques for making candles is also familiar; as I have dealt with all sorts of candles, including poured, dipped, rolled, and sculpted. What is unfamiliar is the amount of care one needs in the selection of the best combination of wicks and waxes for each technique. Buying your 11 pound block of paraffin and some coloring at your local craft store, throwing it all into a heating pot, and pouring the result into a mold with wick will probably lead to a less than perfect result.<br /><br />This brings up the fact that like baking and unlike savory cooking, candlemaking measurements must really be pretty precise, which, among other things, means you really do need a pretty accurate scale for measuring weight. The author makes no suggestions, but I will chime in and say that the type which are best for cooking, the digital, dual unit electronic models are really the best. And, largely agreeing with the author, I will say that this is the ONLY tool that you can share between your kitchen and your candlemaking bench. The author, from long experience, I am sure, says that any tool you use for candlemaking will acquire traces of wax that you will invariably be unable to clean from the tool. This includes all other types of measuring devices.<br /><br />This brings me to the fact that the author has some serious weaknesses in her discussion of measurements. At the top of the list is her mistaking a gallon for 3.76 milliliters (ml) rather than 3.76 Liters. This means she is off by a factor of 1000! While this may not cause any problems for anyone ignoring the metric measurements, it can cause serious headscratching for someone not thoroughly familiar with the metric system, is valiantly trying to work with it for all its obvious examples. My more general issue with Ms. Oppenheimer's measurements is that she interchangeably uses volumes, weights, and relative size (parts). My suggestion would be to stick primarily to metric weights and do conversions to volume only when really necessary, as when you are figuring out how much wax you need to fill a particular vessel to a particular level.<br /><br />My only other major issue I could find with the book is in the fact that Ms. Oppenheimer makes a reference to the color wheel as if this device typically taught in the seventh grade were a working part of all her reader's everyday knowledge. While I have a vague notion of what the color wheel looks like and how its used, I have no certainty that I know where to find one which will work with pigments (one of the things I do remember is that there are different color wheels for combining pigments and beams of light.)<br /><br />Regarding my original purpose for buying this book, I can state that it gives many sound looking techniques for decorating the outside of commercially purchased candles, although I did find a few slips in lists of materials which I would consider a major flaw in a cooking recipe.<br /><br />I recommend this book for the `sophisticated' beginner who is willing, as the author wisely suggests, to do a little experimentation in pursuit of the hobby. If you just want to knock off a few votive candles, buy a ready-made kit for the purpose.<br /><br />Recommended, with warning to keep your brain fully engaged as your read.headscratching for someone not thoroughly familiar with the metric system, is valiantly trying to work with it for all its obvious examples.

She is in trouble with the new chief, because she left to spend time with the mother in Ireland that abandoned her as an infant, and instead of staying her allotted 6 weeks, she stayed four months.  While on the plane, she sees a woman being stalked by a man with a knife.  She leaves her luggage at the airport and goes to save her.  Turns out Marie is a banshee, and Joanne's death is predicted.  The god of the Great Hunt tries to oblige, but fails.  A serial killer connected to him somehow is killing people in Seattle.  The supernatural powers that be insist that Joanne be the one to stop him.  Joanne isn't so sure, up until now, she has shown no shamanistic powers and doesn't know how to use them.  Looks like a learning experience for everyone.    Urban Shaman is a really fast moving paranormal.  The author blends Celtic and Native American lore very skillfully.

The novel O.T. scores three stars for readability, three stars for characterisation, three stars for plot and two stars for literary merit.  Fairy Tales scores five stars in all four categories - denoting a timeless masterpiece - a 'classic'.      In addition, the book discusses 'the novel and the cinema: a study of screen adaptation'.  'Novelists at work: plus a detailed analysis of the work methods of several novelists of widely different kinds'.  'The novel and the book trade: the commercial influences on fiction'.  'Approaches to fiction: a readable guide to critical ideas'.  'The novel and illustration: a history'.      This wonderful book - I first read it in 1992 - opened up world literature to me.  Though I have always dipped regularly into classic fiction and would have read a central work such as Pride And Prejudice by Jane Austen eventually, other novels such as Lilith by George MacDonald and Job by Joseph Roth I might have missed out on.  Some of the 'great' books I have disliked intensely (I am thinking in particular of Sons And Lovers by D.H. Lawrence) - but making my own evaluations of novels is part of the fun!  It has led me to try many different genres.      Any true lover of fiction will snap this book up on sight.  This review is written for those who have never seen or heard of it, to encourage them to get hold of a copy - or get their local library to buy one!  I cannot recommend Novels And Novelists highly enough.  It is essential.	2005-09-15

However, if you are a scientist, educator or serious student who wishes to know more about the concept of working memory, this book is essential reading. The editors have done an excellent job in identifying the 8 most important issues/questions in the field and then asking the authors of the 10 most influential models to attempt to answer these questions using their model. This lets the reader see the different strengths and weaknesses of the different models (in their authors' own words) and their commonalities and differences. The editors then are kind enough to summarize the major issues on which there is consensus, what remains to be debated and useful future directions for research. There is no ultimate conclusion as there is still much work to be done.  <br /> <br />In a nutshell, students if you want to know about working memory, this is THE book. The reason I say students is that all the top researchers in working memory already own a copy of this book.	2005-09-15

The author is fascinated with why some languages became more important and widely-spoken than others and the relationship of language to empire.  He asserts quickly that history offers no pattern or pat solution to this question.<br /><br />Among the language histories that Ostler examines are the very-wide ranging Afro-Asiatic group, which encompasses Arabic, Aramaic, and Coptic among others, Turkish, Persian, Chinese, Sanskrit, Greek, and the major European languages.  He focuses mostly on the literate Old World languages, although he has a chapter on Quechua and Nahuatl, the languages of the Incas and Aztecs respectively. As could be expected in a wide-ranging book, I found some chapters to be more interesting and informative than others.  Scattered amongst the chapters are plenty of good maps and a large number of quotations and reproductions of inscriptions from a large number of languages.  This is a well-produced book.<br /><br />I'll give this book the highest rating, but I must comment that I was a bit disappointed with the cautious conclusions of the author.  One of his more interesting statements was that Arabic, an Afro-Asiatic language, became established only in \"territories that had previously spoken an Afro-Asiatic language\" That suggests that the conquest of one language over another may have something to do with the similarity in structure of the language -- or, in other words, English is not likely to supplant Chinese or the reverse.  This point is not really developed to its fullest extent. Also, the section of the book I most look forward to was \"What makes a language learnable?\" but it is very brief.  I would liked to have seen a lot more discussion of his point that \"the essence of a language, its structure, can play a role in its viability.\"  That's a dangerous and intriguing statement in that it implies that some languages are \"better' than others, a point that deserves more examination.<br /><br />Smallchief	2005-09-15

The romance near the end, said to me, when you accept yourself good things come your way. <br />     I also enjoyed the commentaries on prejudice and how a cause and political correctness can be carried to far.  Creating a whole new set of problems and discomfort. This is a great read! <br />	2005-09-15

This is a thoroughly enjoyable series, although I felt the last book, Days of the Dead, lost it somewhere as it was nowhere near as satisfying as the rest of the series. This book, however, is back with a bang! Ben, Rose and Hannibal team up to follow a bank robber on a paddle-steamer up the Mississippi.

Much like Baruah's monograph on the political troubles in Assam, this work discusses the origins of ethnic conflicts in Northeast India and how these conflicts have perpetuated themselves through both internal jockeying for resources and recognition among ethnic or cultural groups and the unintended consequences of state policies that foster instead of discourage these movements.  Importantly, Baruah details the erosion of true democracy and respect for human rights that both the state and these ethnic movements have precipitated.   <br /> <br />Baruah's conclusion discussing the potential of economic development and a bold \"Look East Policy\" fostering economic trade and cooperation between Northeast India, Burma, China, Nepal, Bhutan, and other Asian countries contiguous with present day Northeast India is insightful and forward thinking, although given the political barriers may be somewhat idealistic in the short term. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent work and one policymakers in India should take seriously if they hope to resolve the problems of this troubled region.	2005-09-15

This book, printed in large format, is originally intended as a comprehensive instructional guide for teachers & reading instructors, to teach students (in grades 9 to12) how to extract & comprehend information from simple passages as well as complex or advanced reading materials.<br /><br />I did not peruse this book in its entirety as my primary interest is only to find out, learn more about,  & then master the seven reading strategies, since I have a passion for reading. Also, I am always looking out for new ways to enhance my own reading pursuits.<br /><br />In a nut shell, with the execution of the seven strategies, it is designed to help teachers to become strategic teachers & students to become strategic readers. To put in simple terms, a strategic teacher/reader employs a repertoire of effective strategies in his/her respective pursuits. The seven strategies have their deep roots in scientifically based research.<br /><br />In reality, I have read & reviewed only the first three chapters, as follows:<br /><br />Chapter 1: The Power of Strategy Reading Instruction;<br />Chapter 2: Becoming a Strategic Teacher;<br />Chapter 3: Understanding the Seven Strategies;<br /><br />& have a quick scan of the remaining chapters, particularly those pages with instructional templates, instructional activities & reproducible forms.<br /><br />So, essentially, chapter 3 is my prime target, which outlines at great length & in depth, the critical attributes of the seven strategies, as follows: (Chapter 3 is actually a crash course for me!)<br /><br />Strategy #1: Activating prior knowledge;<br />Strategy #2: Inferring - reading the lines, between the lines & beyond the lines;<br />Strategy #3: Monitoring-Clarifying - probing the text, thinking & reflecting;<br />Strategy #4: Questioning the author, peers & teachers through self-questioning & formulating questions;<br />Strategy #5: Searching sources - Selecting responses;<br />Strategy #6: Summarising the reading;<br />Strategy #7: Visualising-Organising - constructing mental images &/or graphics organisers;<br /><br />These are the real gems of this book & I have benefited tremendously as a strategic reader as well as a strategic reading coach. I have in fact adapted many of the cognitive strategies in my coaching of kids/teens/adults in the areas of mastering information as well as effective study skills.<br /><br />For the teacher (or parent who yearns to be a learning facilitator at home), & in the light of my own personal & professional experiences, I dare to say this book is a very pragmatic instructional guide. I seldom see a book so packed with instructional aids. Chapter 5 shows you how to organize for strategic reading instruction in your classroom. The last chapter lays out a school-wide implementation model. The references at the back of the book are a goldmine of information.<br /><br />The author, with an impeccable track record (teacher, librarian, principal, superintendent, author of 35 books for parents & educators, consultant)  has certainly contributed a masterpiece to the world of reading!These are the real gems of this book & I have benefited tremendously as a strategic reader as well as a strategic reading coach.

She's 44 and miserable in a life that is nothing like the one she once dreamed of having.  As Kate looks back on the past 30 years, she remembers her mother's constant control and her father's constant attempts to keep his little girl to himself.  She remembers her dreams of being a caterer.  She remembers the men in her life-who betrayed her trust.  And she remembers her two best friends, Ingrid and Moira, who were there by her side through it all.  Most of all, she remembers her life with Rodney, who came along at a low point in her life and offered her stability.  While he gave her a beautiful little house to take care of-and a beautiful son, Charlie-he never gave her the love and attention she needed.  Kate decides that it's time to take control of her life for the first time-to follow her dreams and finally find happiness.  It's never too late, she realizes, to start over. <br /> <br />This spectacular debut is an insightful journey through Kate Cadogan's life.  It's so full of heart and emotion that it's nearly impossible to detach yourself from it.  Kabak creates a wonderfully genuine heroine-one that you'll both relate to and feel for...one who will feel as real as your best friend.  (I'll admit that, on more than one occasion, before going to bed at night, I set down the book and had to remind myself that I was angry with Kate's husband-not mine.)  You'll laugh with her, you'll cry with her, you'll learn from her, and you'll inevitably see a bit of yourself in her.  Cover the Butter is skillfully written with passion, energy, and just the right amount of humor.  It's a delight to read. <br />	2005-09-15

Because I love to read about writers, and the relation between their work and their life her essays always provide a special kind of enjoyment for me. Ozick is also tremendously knowledgeable and one in reading the essays learns a great deal about the writers in question. She also has an acute historical sense. Her writing about Eliot and his influence on the literary culture especially of the whole university world of the post- war period rings so true. She has a subtletly in seeing the complex realities of someone like Eliot. One might be a little wearied by her lengthy study of a friend and fellow student of literature, Alfred Chester but nonetheless this too is a kind of instruction in Reality. She is a storyteller also, and therefore her essays have a quality which makes them move along in a definite direction.<br /><br />A first- rate collection for anyone for whom the literary essay is dear.	2005-09-15

George Carlin apparently ran out of money about a year or so ago. So he went around to publishers and proposed a book that would be an exasperating hodgepodge of boring comedy snippets, misanthropic social observations, condescending non-sequiturs, and incomprehensible anecdotes, all with hardly a laugh to be had by the reader. George Carlin has long been my favorite stand-up comic, as his hard-hitting and subversive explorations of social behavior and belief systems offered both laughs and disconcerting deep thoughts. But after a few uproarious books previously, this one scrapes the bottom of Carlin's barrel. And no, I am not offended by Carlin's unforgiving assault on organized religion; in fact I agree with most of it, or at least I agree with Carlin's thought processes on finding the inconsistencies and errors in faith-based belief systems. This book also has a relatively healthy selection of observations in Carlin's real area of expertise &#8211; linguistics and the popular use of language. But these good points only make up a small portion of the book, and the rest is merely cranky, tiresome, and directionless. For example, large sections of the book consist of lists of so-called comedic thoughts like \"everything except nine is seventeen. Seventeen is actually six.\" Huh? Add to this Carlin's inexorable slide into shocking offensiveness rather than enlightening discomfort, which used to be his mark of genius. This book shows a brilliant subversive transforming into a curmudgeonly misanthrope. Hope he makes a little money off it. [~doomsdayer520~]	2005-09-15

Poor Z. wrote a good bit of crap in the 1980s up to his death in 1994, so if you've read any of that, don't write off the early stuff. <br /> <br />\"Lord of Light\" builds on the foundation of earlier SF.  Whereas the idea of a sleeper-ship whose crew decide to lord it over their charges on the destination planet---and I mean, Lord it over them---might've been a plot in itself for Heinlein or Clarke, Zelazny leaves this so much in the background that it's really handy to have that part indicated on the back cover. <br /> <br />I didn't find the chapters disjointed or mere \"tales,\" though time may pass between them.  I will pass along that, in my teens when I first read the book, it took me a while to catch on that chapter 1 is \"in medias res\"---chapter 2 goes back to the beginning of the story, and the book advances from there. <br /> <br />A clever, funny, poetic, and touching book.  Z's better books are valuable for their style alone, even when the plot and characters are as good as they are here.  He, Vance, and maybe Brunner are the great SF stylists of the Sixties.	2005-09-14

I did giggle a few times but it never really got to the heart of it.  If you really want to know about Tantra I would read another book.  That's what I plan on doing.

I got this paperback a few years ago in Poland, where I browse used books, and where I discovered a ton of great horror writers, and my favorite of them all; Graham Masterton. <br /> <br />Fungus is a fast read. Reading it made me appreciate the clean and safety of my New York City apartment, despite of terrorist threats, cockroaches and my cats yakking up surprises here and there.  <br /> <br />Basic synopsis; some lab experiments that make simple fungi reproduce and grow on a massive rate and take over London.  <br /> <br />The color, texture, array and lightning speed of contamination of the super strong fungi is too much for people living there, and they are either killed (as when they contract it form air, food or water) depending on the kind of fungus they got, it will either blow up from their stomach or mutate them into a walking mushroom, and make them loose all sense of humanity sooner or later. <br /> <br />It's all up to a bitter writer, whose ex wife was the scientist screwing it all up, and a team of other scientists to save what's left of their country before it's blown to bits by the govt. <br /> <br />Great read really, if you can get your hands on. Despite it all being about science and fungus, it didn't have one boring moment.

They were certainly interesting times and he relates the stories very well.  <br /> <br />Second there is the story of how legislation gets passed. There are a hundred senators, all with the main focus of their lives being how to get reelected. Each has a craving to say something, anything, that will keep their face on television and the front pages of newspapers back home. All of them are independent, just like cats, and getting them moving towards the goal of passing any legislation has to be a lot like Hearding Cats.  <br /> <br />The third subject is the spectacular rise in the Republican party in recent years. When Barry Goldwater ran for president, he didn't stand a chance. I can well remember a TV comentator rhetorically asking why anyone of a minority race, anyone living in a city, any working person would vote Republican. They don't ask that question any more. The Republicans have done a supurb job of putting together a coalition that gets them into office, while the Democrats are running around in circles claiming that Bush stole the election.  <br /> <br />Regardless of your views on the Republican vs. Democrat situation, here is a story from the inside of the Senate talking about life as it really is.	2005-09-14

He blends thorough biblical scholarship with wisdom from extensive and varied experience in missionary work and bible teaching. Careful exposition is supplemented with literary and theological discussion. The key word in Acts is witness for Jesus Christ, from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth. God's Spirit anoints the church at Pentecost, leads believers in handling conflicts between converts new and old, and empowers Christians to overcome false beliefs and magic. In Acts, Luke tells this dramatic story with subtle humor.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-14
US	52282628	R2DLG3A7T7F52P	0553573403	268067011	A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Jolly good read	I picked a paperback of this to read on the Banks instead of re-reading another volume of Tolkien's B-sides and loved it more than just about any contemporary fantasy fiction (\"just about\" is a nod primarily to Gaiman). The whole series up to date is a well-thought out and well-plotted multi-polar epic set in something like a Eurasia of X-XII centuries both stirred and shaken. The things I liked most about this novel have to do with elements of realism and relativism rather than fantasy per se. Just like in our own reality the best plans in this book oft go to waste, the smelly stuff regularly hits the fan, and nearly nothing is quite what it seems. Good does not necessarily triumphs over evil, and even if it does you sometimes can not tell the difference with all the blood flowing and body parts flying. Just like in our reality being honorable does not preclude one from untimely demise, actually - again just like in reality - often speeds up the process. I kinda like that - otherwise you get something like Harry Potter, where you know that nothing really is going to happen to the dude, lest the next book is called The Late Harry Potter... Lots of maihem, lots of sex - which is nice too, since I still never quite learned (having read all of the Tolkien's works) how exactly \"orcs are multiplying\"... Heroes do not have to go off on a quest somewhere to get their teeth kicked in - even if they just sit in one place somebody will try to get them. And again. And again. \"Happily ever after\" has a half-life of about two weeks in this book...<br /><br />Two small complaints - the Hollywood script-writing heritage pops its ugly head every now and then in a snappy one-liners, and even unpredictability eventually falls into a pattern when you can see where at least some things are going. But nevermind those, this book and the ones that follow it in the series still make for the titular Jolly Good Read.	2005-09-14

Unfortunately, this first book in Adamson's Lucy Wales series is so very disappointing that by the time I finished reading it, I was frustrated and depressed by the characters and angry at myself for spending the time to finish it. <br /> <br />As was mentioned by the reviewer from Midwest Book Review, Beware the Tufted Duck is told from the point of view of Lucy's unrequited lover, Markus Bloch, who is willing to go to any lengths to impress Lucy.  Unfortunately, as the book unfolds, it becomes apparent that Lucy is not a very nice person; she is, in fact, consistently so bent on getting her own way that she is often rude and inconsiderate.  One begins to question Markus' judgment and wonder how he could possibly be so besotted with Lucy, when she treats him as shabbily as she does. <br /> <br />I read, in part, to enjoy spending time with likeable, inspiring characters.  Since the character of Lucy is remarkable only for her extreme audacity and her knowledge of bird lore, this book was a very unsatisfying read.   <br />	2005-09-14

Headstrong in battle, Washington was still the best and most effective military leader of the Revolution, and his careful style and insistence on stepping aside when the time was right (versus become the military dictator that some feared and many expected) entitle him to much of the admiration that subsequent generations have given him.  An excellent review of the Revolutionary period and the First Presidency.<br /><br />This unabridged 13 CDs (vs. 352pp) audiobook proceeds at a decent pace, and Runger's narration is clear and even, almost, but never quite, to the point of being soporific.	2005-09-14

Finally, the Essentials line gets into the truly modern age of the 80's with this sixth installment of the X-Men franchise, and it's a doozy. Take a second and look at the \"by\" line up top - JR JR, Rick Leonardi, Walt Simonson, Art Adams, Alan Davis. If these names mean nothing to you now, they will be eternally emblazoned in your consciousness after reading this collection... <br />For the price of admission, you get, in this comic vet's opinion, one of the GREATEST fight scenes ever rendered in a comic book - the Wolverine/Sabretooth slugfest from Uncanny #214 rendered by none other than Alan Davis and Paul Neary in their Detective Comics-era prime. If you didn't see this when it came out - hoo boy, you are a lucky little true believer, because you get to read it for the first time!  <br />Another outstanding issue in this collection is the Rick Leonardi/Whilce Portacio (who?) collaboration on Uncanny #201, which has a pretty cool (though for this fan, disappointing) fight between Cyclops and Storm over who gets to lead the X-Men, and, coincidentally, also marks the first appearance of Cable. Another winner. <br />This time out, Marvelously Marvelous Marvel has decided to include some issues of other comics to fill in story gaps - issues of X-Factor and Power Pack that rounded out the overdue \"Mutant Massacre\" storyline that wipes out the crappiest characters ever - the Morlocks. The highlight here is the Walt Simonson/Bob Wiacek rendered X-Factor #10 - 11. I always had a fondness for that run on X-Factor (which are, fyi, cyclops and the rest of the original X-Men), and the only negative thing I can say about this is that right about here you actually start to miss the coloring, as the 80's X-titles had the best hues in the industry... but a small price to pay for such an imppressive package. <br />There are other gems included, but I had to cover the essentials...no pun intended! This marks the era when the X-Men and related titles really started rolling, turninginto the artistic showcase for hot talent in the comic book industry, so if you weren't around for these, or are new to comics, you have to pick this one up... but only AFTER you get Essential X-Men vol.2 and vol.4!

This has become one of my favourite books on incense.  <br /> <br />It begins by describing the origins of incense, and the effects of burning incense, and then the methods and utensils for burning incense.  <br /> <br />He follows this with the outlines for 10 different incense burning ceremonies, with suggested incenses, for a variety of areas - such as clearing and cleansing, sensuality, joy, harmony, protection, energy and transformation, strength, etc. These are also useful as inspiration for creating ones own. <br /> <br />He then goes on to explain the various planes of perception for incense, the four elements, and the centres of perception.  <br /> <br />Next is the section on various incenses. Not exhaustive but covers an adequate range of, mainly, the more easier to obtain incenses. Each one listed with the origin, traditional use, notes on burning as incense, and fragrance message. He also includes any other names for the incense as well as the part of the plant, and corresponding elemental force, and emphasis. My only complaint with this book is that the pictures with each listed incense are all in black and white, making it a little difficult to fully familiarise oneself with the incense. <br /> <br />At the back of the book is a great resources section. The first broken up into the four elements and listing the corresponding incense and emphasis (listed as either mind, body, or emotion)with the 'fragrance message'. The next part being a list of incenses and suggestions for its particular purpose, such as anti-depressive, or diabetes, relaxation, sleep promoting, etc etc.  <br /> <br />All in all, well worth the addition to the library of anyone interested in the use of incenses. <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

He found this book very interesting, and we have re-read it many times. <br /> <br />The book is in a larger format than the original Magic School Bus series, which leave more room for all of the sidebar explanations that typify these books. Cole and Degen explain processes, like growing rice and making silk, that are easy for kids to follow, and may teach the adults a thing or two. A common thread through the whole book is a list of things that the ancient Chinese invented before the West, another point that may teach adults something new. The plot is a little silly, but it made my son and I giggle.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's great fun, and a nice way to introduce kids to Chinese culture. Teachers could read it to a class, then delve more deeply into subjects that they want to pursue.	2005-09-13

Selwyn Raab -- who covered the mob for The New York Times for over two decades -- is one of the foremost experts on organized crime in the United States. Nobody knows the Mob better than Raab. <br /> <br />This book reveals some really captivating tidbits about the Mafia. For example, when Martin Scorsese was making \"The Godfather,\" the Colombo family made it clear to the studio that any negative portrayal of Italian-Americans would not be tolerated.  <br /> <br />So, Paramount actually removed ALL references to \"Mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" from the script, substituting \"family\" and \"syndicate\" instead. To further appease boss Joe Colombo, the producers even hired several of his friends as extras! <br /> <br />But what I really appreciated about this book is that Raab accurately points out that the mafia was -- and still is -- involved in much more than most people realize. He criticizes the popular glorification of mafiosos as endearing bad guys with an honor code, or as just capitalistic criminals who do not bother innocent people.  <br /> <br />\"Five Families\" shows the actual mob lifestyle is bloody and vulgar, and describes how they imposed price increases and intimidation on law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br />\"In real life,\" Raab writes, \"no Mafiosi are 'good guys.'\" <br /> <br />Truer words have never been written... <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-13

It is a personal account of a prominent person (the man who should have become President), yet alarming enough for me to remember what I felt back then when I read it.

They really are great.  The melodies, the harmonies, the bridges - for cryin' out loud, the tempo changes in some of the bridges border on unbelievable, and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word; all of the music is great. <br /> <br />Now, here comes the problem train: the lyrics were all written by best-selling authors.  That sounds great, right?  Well, the problem with authors like that is that they like to get a whole lot of meaning into it.  Sometimes, the meaning or words are really forced and the songs aren't as interesting.  The first three songs, Natty Man Blues, Radio, and We Both Have a Feeling That You Still Want Me, are three of the best songs on the album, mainly because they don't try to get too deep, they try to be fun, good songs.  There are plenty of other songs on the album like these - the title track comes to mind. <br /> <br />But there are plenty that are forced, and, frankly, not very good.  That's why I gave it four stars.  The musicianship is great, the melodies are nice, and a good number of the songs are just a pleasure to listen to.  Others, though, you'll want to sort of tune out the lyrics and simply listen to them as songs without words, exactly.	2005-09-13

It started out with Superman flying around Metropolis, but no crimes were going on so he landed. Then it flashed back to this kid who was tricked by the supervilans. After that the kid told Superman. Superman then went underground and stoped them. The next day an unknown being escaped from captivity and began destroying everything. The Justice League called him doomsday. Doomsday and Superman faught until the death. The last blow from both of them ended up killing both of them. the ending of the book was very emotional (sad). I do recomed this book for children 10 and older because of the ending. the ending would be devestating to a child who looks up and believes in Superman.

This should be required reading for all kids ages 13 through 99.  Keep On Keeping On is fun to read and challenges us as we experience the frustrations, disappointments, and triumphs that Mike and Tim face just making it through what to most of us is just an ordinary day.  The book poignantly places us in the shoes of Mike who is constantly challenged by a life with cerebral palsy.<br /><br />It is refreshing to read Tim's book which restores our faith in others and in our own hearts, and reminds us not to fear or exclude from our lives those with great challenges.

Justin drives for help while Annie sits stunned at the site of her daughter's disappearance. She cannot contemplate the reality of what must have happened to Ursula. Instead, she thinks of the generations concentrated into that one precious tiny being.    The reader is catapulted into riveting tales of Ursula's ancestors, beginning with the Chinese alchemist Qin Lao on her father's side in third century B.C. China. His life-long quest is to discover the secret of immortality, though there's a problem: he has a wife but no heir. He acquires a second wife and concubine, but to no avail. The birth of his son, when it finally occurs, is remarkable --- maybe magical.    Interspersed with stories of Ursula's forebears are chapters of the here and now, as Justin summons rescuers, the media gathers, and the young parents wait in agony. The reader experiences Justin's and Annie's memories of their own childhood and the time before and after their daughter's birth.    In the present, people all over the country watch Ursula's rescuers on television. They wonder if the girl is alive and how deep into the earth she has fallen.    In the past, Annie's ancestors live in eighth-century Finland and are about to meet. Curiously, both are deaf and mute. After they marry, they remain childless for years, possibly due to spells a spiteful witch has cast against them. Even after the witch burns to death, the two remain childless until they are past fifty, when they find themselves expecting. And what of the witch's curse? Could it affect their descendents, clear down to Ursula, lost in the mineshaft?    We return to Annie, who is bent on distracting herself from Ursula's plight. She is remembering a chain of events in her girlhood, which terminated in her being permanently disabled by a car hitting her.    Back and forth through time we travel. Each linked story is a perfect gem, with the feel of a fable. Each character is a fully realized individual and completely fascinating. We read of a true virgin birth, foundlings, concubines, fathers on the run, immigrants, witches, royalty, gypsies, foxes, lepers, and more --- while in the back of our minds, like a beating heartbeat, pulses the question: What has happened to Ursula?    As I turned the pages and Ursula's forerunners came to life before me in exquisite detail, I also began to sense my own ancestors' stories concentrated within me --- quite an unusual perspective. URSULA, UNDER is irresistibly fascinating, thought-provoking and suspenseful, and is packed with diverse historical elements from different countries and different ages. Without question it is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend it.       --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon [...]	2005-09-13

We have been homeschooling for nine years and I have looked at many math books during that time.  This pre-algebra guide  gives quick and thorough explanations of concepts where you need clearer explanations or a refresher on forgotten topics.  My 14 year old and I both like the number of practice problems offered, and we have found this book to be very helpful in making great strides in algebra.   Most practice problems have the answers in the back of the book.  The only way this book could be improved is if the answers to *all* the problems were in the back of the book.

At times emotional or sharp-tongued, Will-Yam in the Land of Giants stresses very real social problems including a stifling educational system that focuses too heavily on the kids most in trouble, child sexual abuse, exploitation, the greed of athletic companies in dictating the futures of sports players too young to make life-changing decisions, and much more. The testimony of Steinman's own childhood experiences - mild compared to some yet so severely terrible they left permanent scars on his life - drives home his call for reform. Some of his prospective ideas may be controversial, such as completely eliminating competitive sports and their accompanying elitism or big-company exploitation from schools, and adopting a twelve-month school year as well as a federal-only educational funding plan. Yet the very real need to improve quality of life and opportunity for young people who cannot speak up or vote for themselves is beyond dispute. Highly recommended.	2005-09-13

Great Author, not great novel.<br /><br />I am a fan of Mark Helprin:  I loved \"Refiner's Fire\" and \"A Soldier of the Great War.\"  In this novel, for which I had high hopes, based on the reviews and \"critical acclaim,\" he loses me.  I find that I am not enjoying it and it is like slogging through thigh-deep snow.  I keep thinking, in a few more pages, he'll hook me.  It isn't happening at page 130 of 673.  (I once read 3/4 of the way through an acclaimed Rushdie book, waiting for the story to begin and found nothing but style.  I resolved to never do that again.)<br /><br />This book is far too self-consciously artistic and stylish for me.  All the fancy words really get in the way of the story.  All of his books that I have read involve some \"fantastic\" writing - flight of fancy in a fantasy realm.  And I love it, in small, measured doses.  Here, it is the basic structure of the novel, and it's way too much.  The semi-magical protagonist of bizarre origin is here, like his other books.  The wild and woolly life of adventure, the sexual encounters, the interesting characters are all here - but burdened with far too much fancy, flowery prose.<br /><br />\"Too many words, Mozart, too many words!\"<br /><br />Critics seem to always gush over this stuff.  Is this because they all, in their deepest hearts, wish they were poets instead?  I love poetry.  I love prose.  If they get too mixed up together, it becomes dreck, for me at least.  Clearly, this book is beautiful in the eyes of some of those beholding it.<br /><br />Here's a perfect example.  You may love this sort of thing, and, if so, here's your book.  I can only take this in very small doses before I lose interest:<br /><br />\"And then he saw the a strange white cloud moving across the now golden face of the city's cliffs in the sunset.

They wheeled across the skyline like particles of smoke in Brownian motion, caught brilliantly in a dark chamber by a clear stroke of light reverberating between a sky and a floor of yellow brass.  Next to the bodies of the buildings they were like mites, or snow, or confetti, or dust ... and yet they were one single flight, rising like a plume in the wind.  Peter Lake knew from this that the city would take care, for it was a magical gate through which those who entered passed in innocent longing, taking every hope, showing touching courage - and for good reason.

Both the quanity and quality of images in books have exploded in the past few years.  A great example of this is the book \"Ship: the Epic Story of Maritime Adventure\" by Brian Lavery and published by DK. There are literally hundreds of amazing drawings, paintings and wooden models of every ship type that you can imagine.    In contrast, when Edwin Tunis published this book in 1952, beautiful, high quality color illustrations were reserved for the most expensive books. Black and white line illustrations were the preferred and most economic method of illustrating picture books.  These were the types of books, that I grew up reading and loving in the 1960's and 1970's.      To be a successful line illustrator required great imagination.  The illustrations not only had to be top notch, the image had to be composed within an interesting context.  Edwin Tunis was one of the great masters of this style of illustration.  This book not only has great images of boats and ships but these vessels are doing interesting things.  As an example, his image of a whale boat shows a dead whale riding next to the ship while the crew is harvesting the whale's oil.  These were the types of details that enrichen illustations and help capture a reader's imagination.    Edwin Tunis was one of the great illustators of his day.  Be sure to look at his other books.  If you like Edwin Tunis, be sure to check out the works of Eric Sloane, another master illustrator.	2005-09-13

This book is, without a doubt, the most useful book I've ever read in my life.  I read it about two years ago, and still think back to it often.  At the time, I was involved with an abusive man and stuck in the cycle of trying to figure out why he acted the way that he did, and how I could improve the relationship.  Now I'm not with him anymore, and I won't say it's just because of this book, but it certainly helped.  And now that I really understand the dynamics of abusive relationships, I can be confident that I won't fall for it again.  Since I read the book, I have met many men who in the past I would have given a chance (well, probably a bunch of chances) and largely because of what I learned from this book, I don't and won't.   <br />The great thing about this book is that it makes it really hard for you to stay in denial, thinking he could change, he just has a bad temper, etc.  It does that because what he says makes so much sense that you don't just have to take his word for it, you can use your common sense and see that it's true.  And having that knowledge is the only thing that makes it impossible to manipulate me like my ex did.  It is truly amazing how transparent it all became once I read this book.  The last time we spoke, he tried to manipulate me like he always did, only this time it didn't work.  And so he tried every tactic he had, one right after another, like he was going down a list.  It would have been kind of funny if it wasn't so evil.  He finally gave up and hung up on me when I started telling him about himself.   <br />This book is so important that I wish everyone would read it, not just people who have dealt with abusive relationships....an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, right?  This is the only book that I recommend to people on a regular basis and the only book that I can say really had an impact on my life. <br />The only problem is that it's so frustrating hearing the myths presented as truths everywhere you look, onTV, other books, in conversation, everywhere.  I just wish everyone would read this book.	2005-09-12

Lushly illustrated with photos both of the foods and of peoples and places from around the world, each recipe is enhanced with quotes from various sources, which are 'slipped in' in a very palatable manner.  There are many resources included for a variety of services, agencies, and organizations, relevant to vegans and lifestyle conscious people in general.  <br /> <br />A section on \"preparation basics\"  covers cooking methods and equipment.  A \"soaking and sprouting\" chart, as well as a chart covering the how and how much of cooking grains, are very helpful. <br /> <br />Raw food recipes are included, in addition to complete menus and meal suggestions.  Contributors to the cookbook and The Blossoming Lotus restaurant are nicely acknowleged. <br /> <br />This cookbook combines the best features of my favorite cookbooks into one.  It makes for enjoyable reading in addition to being a handy reference.  I consider it to be a gift to the vegan cook, or any cook.	2005-09-12

I worried at the outset that the first-person voice of the autistic narrator might become too precious or oppressive, but I needn't have worried.  Hadden deftly handles the challenge he set for himself in presenting a consistent, authentic voice which, in light of the narrator's inability to understand jokes or interpret feelings, is ironically funny, insightful, and empathetic.  I also think this book will appeal to, and is appropriate for, young adult readers.  I have recommended it to my 13-year-old son, and I think it will provide a great foundation for a discussion with him about human relationships, loyalty, betrayal, our efforts to understand each other, the challenges we set for ourselves and, of course, the novel form itself.	2005-09-12

This is a great book for North Indian Cooking. Myself and my husband, Jameson Thottam love to cook at home together. We love to try different recipes and on occasion love to trade recipes as our own mode of exchanging insider trading tricks with other cooking afficiandos. When my husband comes home after a long day at work, he works in the financial aspect of businesses'(he used to work with Morgan Stanley, Homestore and IndyMac Bank), he unwinds by joining me in the kitchen. This book has allowed us to explore the different aspects of North Indian Cooking. Indian cooking allows for the use of exotic ingredients such as, turmeric, coriander, curry leaves, tamarind, sec kanjii powder, manjala, pullie,... I look forward to the south indian version of this book. Ms. Jaffrey's easy to follow style is addictive to perfecting cooking secrets. <br /> <br />We both highly recommend this book, <br />Regards - Elizabeth and Jameson Thottam <br /> <br />	2005-09-12

I don't think any of these stories will ever be anthologized in a collection of say, \"Best Short Stories of the End of the 20th Century.\"  What's good about these stories is Chabon's gift of observation.  It's been a couple of weeks since I read this book, and I still think of some of the images it contains. He's very good at picking out the salient detail and describing it in a way that gives it a resonance beyond mere description.  Here's a boy with a box of laboratory supplies belonging to his banished father:  \"I knelt down and wrapped my arms around the carton and lowered my face into it and inhaled a clean, rubbery smell like that of a new Band Aid.\"  Here's a six-foot-eight athlete- turned- tycoon in a business suit:  \"He wore silver aviator eyeglasses and a custom-tailored suit, metallic gray, so large and oddly proportioned that it was nearly unrecognizable as an article of human clothing and appeared rather to have been designed to straiten an obstreperous circus elephant or to keep the dust off some big, delicate piece of medical imaging technology.\"  I think that's good stuff.  I just wish I had been able to become involved in the stories, or maybe have identified with one of the characters once in a while.  Most of the characters are people who are unconnected to their surroundings.  Parents have failed their children, children have failed their parents, ex-spouses want they-don't-know-what from each other.  The book is populated almost exclusively by people who are resigned to failure.  As a result, there's a certain smug undertone to all the stories that I found off-putting.  I did not find any of the stories very emotionally involving.  My basic reaction to each story was a smirk.  Considering Chabon's legions of fans, surely his reputation does not rest on his short stories.  One of these days I'll give oneof his novels a try.	2005-09-12

This book is 900+ pages of outstanding material on what is really an art - assembly language programming.  The author, a university professor, has done what so many other authors have failed to do:  take a complicated subject and break it down into easy-to-digest pieces.  More importantly, it's written in clear, understandable language.  Although not for the faint hearted - you really have to want to learn assembly language programming - the serious student should have no problems.  What's really neat (IMHO) is that the author's proven system - called High Level Assembler (HLA) - is used throughout the book.  HLA, although slightly different from 'regular' assembler, is easy to learn and very, very logical.  The CD-ROM included with this book contains the HLA, the HLA library of routines, all of the source code in the book and over 50,000 lines of sample code.  Again, if you want to learn assembly language, this is \"the\" book you should have in your library!!!	2005-09-12

This book suffers from numerous problems. The first is that while it claims to be about \"the power of thinking without thinking,\" this is only one of three ideas that are discussed. The failure to mention the other ideas in the title might have been acceptable if they were mentioned explicitly in the text, but it is unclear that Gladwell realizes the distinction. The second problem is that the book is made up of six distinct essays, and they have been sloppily edited to produce a book that is simultaneously disjoint and repetitive. Though perhaps the second problem is really just a symptom of the third problem, that Gladwell's style is painfully repetitive to begin with. Gladwell does not simply beat dead horses, he beats the dust into which he has reduced their carcasses. The fourth problem is that towards the end of the book Gladwell goes off on a tangent about \"situational autism\" that is both poorly motivated and very likely to offend the autistic community. And finally, rather than having an introduction and conclusion that tie the book together, these sections present whole new situations; the conclusion in particular seems largely unrelated to the rest of the book. <br /> The book has four points. First, is that the human mind has an impressive ability to process information at an unconscious level very quickly. For instance, by listening to a brief snippet of a doctor speaking, even if the recording is digitally altered so that all you can hear is the tone, you can very accurately determine whether the doctor has good bedside manner. Similarly, by watching a few seconds of a college professor's lecture, even with the sound turned off, you can make a remarkably accurate determination of whether the professor is a good lecturer. <br /> The second point is that this ability often leads us astray. Our unconscious can be shown to harbor prejudices against blacks, women, and others, and these prejudices are bad for both us and society. And on a less socially relevant note, people consistently prefer the taste of liquor that comes in fancy bottles. The book gives absolutely no advice about how to improve our unconscious's attitudes towards either minorities or conventional packaging of foodstuffs. <br /> Without explicitly mentioning it, the book points out the importance of making decisions based on relevant information, rather than large quantities of irrelevant data. The best example of this is given in the introduction. An apparently ancient Greek statue is analyzed with all sorts of fancy chemistry equipment, and the lab technicians come back and say that the marble is indeed from an ancient Greek quarry and that the surface of the marble has a chemical composition that is usually the result of centuries of weathering. On the other hand, any art historian worth his salt can tell you that the feet of the statue are carved in a style never seen in any other Greek statue. While the information from the chemists seems more concrete (their equipment costs more), the relevant fact here is the style of carving in the feet-the statue is a modern forgery. <br /> Finally, the book talks about ways to improve decision making under intense time pressure, for instance in a military engagement or police shootout. The conclusion, not surprisingly, is that practice making split-second decisions is important. Also, if you can slow down the pace of the engagement in order to allow yourself more time, you should do so, but if slowing down gives your opponents a greater advantage, you shouldn't. <br /> If you have made it through this review, there is certainly no need to read the book. Every idea Gladwell had has been summarized and clarified here. Which should really make you wonder how he stretched the book past 20 pages, let alone 200! <br />	2005-09-12

Her methods have been extraordinarily beneficial to our children, & I think I would have collapsed by now without knowing that someone else out there does indeed understand.  <br /> <br />Nancy's books are vital, as some states (like mine) have ZERO resources for RAD.

Not only is it up-to-date and thorough but it blends a current knowledge of the Spanish wine industry with insights into Spain's history and culture. Robert Parker (aka God), the world's leading wine critic, has said of Spanish wine that,\"Spain has done an outstanding job of maintaining respect for its traditions of the past and also looking forward to the future.\" This wine revolution is perfectly captured in Murdock's book. <br />However, this is not just a (well above) average reference book on Spanish wine regions and their wines. This book is far more. It is a personal journey, literally, among the highways and byways- most Spanish wineries are on byways- where the author talks to a wide cross-section of individuals involved in wine-making. This allows the reader to hear the voices of those actually making the wide variety of quality wines which Spain is now producing. <br />In this personal account the author's acute perceptions, deep knowledge, wit and sheer passiopn of and for Spanish wines burns through. At the end of this excellent read Murdock modestly states that he is no 'expert' but '...after a helluvah lot of work, I also should know what I am talking about.' Indeed he does. <br />As a wine merchant based in Spain and having visited many of the same places and tasted the same wines as the author I can bear witness to its accuracy and insight. This first-class book will appeal not only to all those who wish to explore Spanish wines but also ita charming people and rich culture.	2005-09-12

Having lived in South Africa myself, I can attest that the historical accuracy of the novel is about as precise as one could hope for in a country where history has been regularly molded to fit the politics of the group in power at the time, white or black.  While the historical accuracy and relevance of events such as the Mfecane & Battle at Blood River have been questioned and downplayed recently by the ANC, the impact of these events (or stories, depending on your interpretation of history) were highly important during the time in which Michener was writing this book (i.e., slightly over a decade before the symbolic end to the National Party's apartheid regime with the release of Nelson Mandela in 1994).  <br /> <br />Michener also does a masterful job of describing the nuances between the various racial and ethnic groups which differ by country of origin, tribe, etc.  Although some reviewers have criticized the lack of breadth in coverage of the various African tribes, he does cover today's two most influential Nguni groups (Zulu & Xhosa), while also touching on the Khoisan (or Khoi Khoi) early on.  This novel also provides a solid understanding of the basis for apartheid (if such a thing can truly be 'understood'), while highlighting how some Boer and many more non-Boer whites despised the system.  All in all, I found this to be both historically accurate (or enlightening, for readers unfamiliar with the history of this region) and a highly entertaining read.	2005-09-12

I decided that it would be a good idea to get one of the audio CDs of his work, so that I could have something to listen to while I practiced meditation. <br /> <br />What I found was an experience that further cemented my interest in Buddhism.  Thich Nhat Hanh's lessons on this CD begin with the essentials of Buddhist practice (breathing in meditation) to ruminations on the seeds of suffering, the experiences of life and death in the human body, and the interconnectedness of all things.   <br /> <br />All in all, it's not a bad overview to various aspects and ideas expounded by Buddhist teachers, and Thich Nhat Hanh's voice is smooth, melodic, and compassionate.  It's easy to understand why he has become such a prolific teacher, when his ideas come naturally despite English being his second language.   <br /> <br />The CD can drag in parts (especially towards the end of Disc 1), but all in all it's charming, insightful, at times funny and at times moving, and I couldn't recommend it higher.  I've listened to it dozens of times, and I'll listen dozens more.  If you are interested in listening to a teacher of Buddhism yourself, and are perhaps unable to find one in your area (like me) this is a great, affordable opportunity.	2005-09-12

Naturally those idealistic kids are really thieves, liars, manipulative, clinically crazy, and...terrorists!  Lessing is a writer strongly motivated by spite, particularly spite against ideas about which she has become disillusioned.  (In fact, she has some very interesting things to say about the functions of spite in parts of the Golden Notebook.)  Unlike her disillusioned writing about the left in the Children of Violence cycle and the Golden Notebook, this book contains not one person who is both an ordinary, functional human being and a person who seriously believes that society can be improved--and even her disillusioned former-liberal characters have rolled over to Thatcherism with such feeble excuses about the laziness and pettiness of the youth!  Her villains are laughably crazy and manipulative--at least the villainous left wingers in the Golden Notebook were complex enough that you could understand their power.  (An awful lot of people who have never done political activism or met a left-wing person read this book and assume that it really depicts the world of activists, because people who don't really care too much about politics assume that those who do are crazy zealots.)  Lessing's other, better work shows that world more accurately in both its bright and dark aspects. (On that note, I feel that Lessing has written herself out about the left by the end of the Children of Violence cycle--later, wonderful books like Diary of a Good Neighbor and merely very good books like Mara and Dan deal with new issues.  One of the amazing things about Doris Lessing is that where many writers go through one or at most two big themes/phases in their writing careers, she has gone through, oh, four or five.)	2005-09-12

There are a couple of reviews that mentioned errors. I checked the company website before buying and downloaded the current errata (updates) document as I did for the Sybex book also. I didn't have any problems with either book from the updates. The Crosswind book was good and to the point on what was needed without trying to digest entire pages of text and having to determine what was important. The Sybex book was a bit heavy and harder to digest. I haven't taken the test yet, but a few study buddies who just passed said the Crosswind and Rita questions were more like the real exam than the Sybex questions.	2005-09-12

First of all, I expected the wheels on the books to be 3 dimensional so that my son could actually play with them and roll them around.  Rather, they are made of cardboard and won't really stand up on their own.  Secondly, the outer case that holds the set is not durable at all for little hands.  I only had mine for a couple of days and my son accidently tore the tab off that was supposed to hold the book in place.  Also the snap is impossible to snap and there is no handle, so he couldn't carry it anyway.  I've just put the case up on a shelf and am letting him have the books by themselves.  On the positive side, the books themselves are cute.  My son likes the pictures and likes that they look like vehicles, even if they won't roll.	2005-09-11

When we first looked at the book, we thought to ourselves....hmmm, what could someone tell us about fasting that every minister in the church hasn't already told us? Well, were we in for a surprise...a very interesting but pleasant surprise!  Not only were we educated in the most inspiring way, but there was such an anointing that transpired from the context of the book, that we couldn't put it down once we started reading. Then, when we finished the book, not only did we know that \"Fasting as unto the LORD\" was truly a sacrifice, but one that we couldn't wait to do. This book inspired us with such a powerful anointing, that we shared it with others that were planning on or had thought of fasting. They too felt something special transpire upon reading it. This is a must read for anyone interested in Fasting. You will never approach fasting in the same light again.

For the practicing clinician, this is an invaluable work outlining the prevalent theoretical frameworks in couples therapy. It is interesting and readable, not the dry academic tome the previous reviewer claims it to be. And it actually includes narrative therapy and emotionally focused therapy! two cutting-edge modalities that give us hope the field is finally coming out of the Dark Ages when cognitive-behavioural therapy was the best we had to offer. (No wonder couple therapy has had such poor results!) It does a good job of discussing the basics of the most difficult work a therapist can do, covering many issues couples might have to deal with (see the table of contents). I would wish for more discussion on especially difficult issues such as working with secrets, blended families, high-conflict couples, immigrant/refugee issues, or the impact of trauma generally.

Almost everything written on Taoism is concerned solely with Taoist philosophy.  That's great, but Taoism has always been about much more than philosphy.  It's always been focused on practice.  There are some academic books written about Taoist practice, but these book are normally extremely detailed regarding a very specific era or activity.  They're also generally written in academic-speak.  Then there are books in the popular market which claim to represent Taoism but actually don't exhibit even the slightest familiarity with the subject.  There are no serious, non-academic journals or magazines focused on Taoism.  I've always felt bad for normal people who want to investigate Taoism.  They haven't had much to support or guide them.  I can't blame beginners for sometimes getting the idea that Taoism is really just the philosophy of Laozi.  The Taoist Manual is among the first books of its kind - it really tries to make Taoism, and not just Taoist philosophy, accessible to the average reader.  It tries to systematically go through the major aspects of the Chinese Taoist experience,  and it does so in simple language, with copious photos and diagrams, and basic references.  It's a surprisingly ambitious book, and in general I think it does a pretty good job.  Of course I have a list of quibbles, small things that I would like to see changed.  There's nothing on my list, however, that a good editor couldn't repair in a subsequent edition.  Overall, this is a really worthwhile book.  For a non-academic beginner who wants to learn about real Taoism, this is the place to start.	2005-09-11

What she does is almost ridiculous, but it really brings you into the story. Many times I'd slap myself on the forhead in shocked weariness and yell \"what??!!\", haha. <br /> <br />Vess, the bad guy, is a great villain. Brilliant and evil to the core, my mouth dropped open at some of the stuff he did.

Wilkie Collins' suspense thriller \"Armadale\" contains no less than four main characters, named Allen Armadale - two fathers, each with a single son and heir. Only one Allen Armadale, however, is the rightful owner of the estate, Thorpe-Ambrose, plus a fortune in pounds sterling, and title to land and wealth in Barbados, West Indies. Although the plot sounds convoluted, if only by containing so many characters of the same name, I have to say this is compelling reading at its best, and the narrative is extremely understandable and well paced. The author is a master storyteller.<br /><br />Allen Armadale, (let's call him #2), makes a death bed confession in 1832, at the Swiss health resort of Wildbad. The only English speaker available to document the dying man's final words is a Scot, Mr. Neal. This shocking written disclosure is then mailed to Armadale's executors to be given to his infant son, (Allen Armadale #3), when he comes of age.<br /><br />Armadale, (#2), nee Wrentmore, was born in Barbados and upon turning twenty-one he received a surprise inheritance from his godfather, a Mr. Armadale, of Thorpe-Ambrose in Norfolk, England. The young man would become the owner of his godfather's considerable Barbadian estate on the condition that he change his name to match that of his benefactor. It was thus that Allen Wrentmore became Allen Armadale, the largest proprietor and wealthiest man on Barbados. The elder Armadale had just disinherited his own profligate son, Allen Armadale #1. The infamous son, going by the pseudonym Fergus Ingleby, turns up in Barbados shortly thereafter and befriends his distant cousin, the newest addition to the Armadale line. The consequences of this relationship are dire.<br /><br />Years later, another pair of Armadale men (#3 and #4), both in their early twenties, meet and become the best of friends. Although each has been warned never to come into contact with the other, there is, initially, no way for them to recognize each other's true identities. As with their forefathers, a generation before, a pseudonym is involved here. Unlike their fathers, however, both are totally innocent of malicious intent.<br /><br />All four Allen Armadales are connected by the most enigmatic, fascinating villainess that I know of in literature, Lydia Gwilt - although her name leaves much to be desired aesthetically. Miss Gwilt, perhaps fiction's first femme fatale, is a beautiful, sensual, flame-haired temptress. She is also a bigamist, dope addict, forger, and murderess....at the very least, and probably the book's most intelligent personage. Her intrigues drive the plot of this gripping drama: a tale of murder, espionage, counter-espionage, criminal fraud, adultery, inescapable destiny, romantic rivalries, confused identities, innumerable secrets and lies. Also included in the storyline is a chilling portrait of an abortionist with a bizarre clinic, which he utilizes with lethal intent. Amazingly, Mr Collins' book was published in 1866...and we complain about too much crime and violence in today's entertainment! A book reviewer of the period wrote of Lydia Gwilt in the \"The Athenaeum,\" (1866), \"One of the most hardened female villains whose devices and desires have ever blackened fiction.\" I find that none of Collins' characters are all good or all bad, though, and Miss Gwilt certainly earned my sympathy on more than one occasion. The author's three dimensional characters are just one of the many reasons \"Armadale\" is such an addictive read.<br /><br />Collins controls complex plots and subplots with seeming ease. He focuses on the question of fate as opposed to free will. Are our destinies predetermined or can they be altered? One of the main characters fights relentlessly against what he is convinced is his fate. At other times, he seems reconciled to it. The novel also introduces the first private detective that I know of in fiction, in the person of Mr. Bashwood - certainly no model for Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade or Mike Hammer.<br /><br />Wilkie Collins was a close friend of Charles Dickens, and they both serialized their popular fiction, called 'sensation novels' by many. The nineteenth-century Victorian serial novel allowed authors to make a single story last for years, like today's most popular soap operas. This type of fiction was much more topical, and targeted a wider audience than our soaps, however. The history of the serial gives an understanding of how important writers like Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins were to serial publication and how important serial publication was to nineteenth-century readers. Other popular episode writers of the time were Alexander Dumas, Anthony Trollope, George Eliot, William M. Thackeray, etc.. Wilkie Collins, called master of the cliff-hanger is famously quoted for saying: \"Make 'em cry, make 'em laugh, make 'em wait - exactly in that order.\"<br /><br />A recently discovered interview with Wilkie Collins reveals that \"Armadale\" was his own favorite among his works. I have read both \"The Woman in White\" and \"The Moonstone\" and found them to be exceptional, really great reads. \"Armadale\" may be the best of the three. I was absolutely riveted. Highly recommended!<br />JANAs a close friend of Charles Dickens, and they both serialized their popular fiction, called 'sensation novels' by many.

Never having heard of the author before, I came across a copy in our local library and took it out to read to my visiting god-daughter.

Although the author deals with serious and even tragic topics, she does so with great sensitivity and with humour.  We rolled with laughter at some of the scenes.  The serious side of things led to interesting discussions about life, and I appreciated Julie Johnston's courage in presenting such topics for children to consider, in a context which was not too difficult for them to digest.  My god-daughter still likes to talk about the time we read this book and how much she enjoyed it.<br />Since reading this book, I have read Adam and Eve and Pinch Me, which I also enjoyed, but not as much as Hero of Lesser Causes.	2005-09-11

He unquestionably has good writing skills, adroitly able to create graphic verbal pictures.  His plot however is studded with superfluous violence beyond essential in the advancement of the plot.  The inclusion of cruelty to animals strikes a raw nerve.<br /><br />His inculpable protagonist Henry \"Hank\" Thompson was a talented ex-California high school baseballer.  His potential sterling professional career got short circuited due to a crippling leg injury during a game.  He eventually migrated across the country settling in New York City, where he worked in a Lower East Side joint as a bartender.<br /><br />Hank was convinced to care for a cat named Bud by his neighbor Russ, who needed to travel to Rochester to attend to his dying father.  Bud quickly became a prized companion for him.  Shortly thereafter, the poor slob Thompson was inexplicably beaten so severely in the bar by two Russian gangsters it necessitated the removal of a kidney.  He did however remember discovering a key hidden in the carrying case of Bud.<br /><br />The key was the focus of two opposing criminal groups who proceeded to beat and torture Thompson attempting to acquire it.  The groups, one led by crooked cop, detective Lieutenant Roman and the other consisting of two man crime wave, cowboy garbed brothers Ed and Paris proceed to kill all of Thompson's friends from the bar including his one time girlfriend, Yvonne.<br /><br />When neighbor Russ reappears he informs Hank that the key opens a storage locker containing a king's ransom of ill gotten cash that Thompson realizes he wants for himself.  He proceeds to mete out his own brand of violence partially in retribution but mainly attempting to thwart the others from securing the hefty hoard.	2005-09-11

I knew a lot about weight-training, and designed my own workouts for my own needs (I was a wrestler). But coming back into the game I knew I would need something that clearly told me what to do, and when to do it. This was necessary because it is really hard to get in the habit of weight-lifting, especially when you have plenty of other stuff going on.  <br />This book does exactly what it is designed to do: provide clear routines, with instructions and pictures for performing exercises correctly. Even those of us who have been athletes for years can benefit from this, because it is quite easy to lose control of your form in an attempt to move to heavier weights more quickly. This book will help you get into the routine and make progress, which is the best you can ask for from a book. The rest comes from within.	2005-09-11

I have read quite a few of the reviews and felt I needed to respond to some of the criticisms back and forth. First, it IS true that Chris Paolini used themes that have been around since homo sapiens first sat at the campfire and exchanged tales and myths. Secondly, yes, there ARE limited themes to write about, simply because the scope of human experience is so universal. Thirdly, very few people opting to write in the fantasy genre can escape the extremely long shadow of Tolkien, who really set the bar high for all fantasy authors present and future. <br /> <br />That being said, there's yet plenty of room to wiggle about under such limitations. We know this to be true. Stories from \"Beowulf\" to the \"Harry Potter\" series have proven that even with familiar themes, a good story is simply...a good story. There are lots of fantasy authors--Lewis, Alexander, LeGuin, Zimmer Bradley, Anthony, Kennealy-Morrison, Salvatore, McCaffrey, Donaldson...even the Pinis (of ElfQuest fame)--who took these basic common threads of storytelling and created a vivid tapestry which allowed readers to see the things they wrote about as \"real\". <br /> <br />It IS a given that reading is a matter of taste and preference. For example, I happen to admire Thomas Hardy, but abhor James Joyce. But I can, in some way, find a merit for both because they gave me something to think about. Some have insisted that they find Mr. Paolini entertaining...ok, that's fine. Unfortunately, once the hype over this book has long faded (and it will), I highly doubt it will stand the test of time the way say, S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" has (She also published at a young age). And I doubt if these same fans will likewise read Paolini's books again with the same zeal 20 years hence.  <br /> <br />If, as some argue, that this young man is a genius, then we must hold him to a higher standard than an \"ordinary\" person his age striving for the same thing. This means we must be so transported to the world he created as to simply not care if he \"borrowed\" some elements from the Greats (and even They \"borrowed\" from each other). In fact, we would smile and get on with the story. But if the story is poorly executed (and I believe in this case it has been), then these \"borrowed\" elements look like a crutch, an obvious tool to use whenever young Mr. Paolini's imagination got stuck. And that does both us and him a grave disservice. <br /> <br />Lastly, I want to emphasize to the reviewer who earlier stated that the negative reviews were obviously written by children...well for the record, I am 40 years old and it is MY belief that old or young, bad is bad and good is good. Age has little to do with talent or preference. The overall feeling is that many were simply let down by something that seemed so promising with the first novel. It is my hope that the author will read some of these reviews and listen to some of the critics, if only to gain some true perspective of where he stands with those he wishes to read his works. It does no good to have so little regard for your audience, that you choose ego over substance and originality. My fear is that if Mr. Paolini is not careful, there may BE no audience left to pay heed to his words.	2005-09-11

Ever	Ok, so I am a foodie, I have been cooking for years, and made the decision to not kill that love by going to cooking school and making it my full-time job.  Instead I went to law school.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Anthony for a long time now, his attitude and adventuristic style comport with my own.  I received a copy of this cookbook, and had it kicking around on my shelf for a few months.  Then came my wife's birthday.<br /><br />I am a cook who already knows what I want the end result to be, and usually just refer to cookbooks for temperatures and times, and the occasional idea for what else to add to a dish.  I guess that I use cookbooks as reference manuals, not for rote instructions.<br /><br />I decided to make rack of lamb, as we were in the mood for meat, and that is an especially nice meal to drop on your guests: some veg, some potatoes, and three or four ribs of lamb with a red wine reduction. Pop a few bottles, and ... Nice.<br /><br />So I was cruizing my cookbooks for ideas, and came upon his book.  I read through the recipe for \"carre d'agneau au moutarde\" and thought, geez, this is simple and looks really good.  I decided to just do his recipe whole nut.  It was spectacular.  An absolute hit.<br /><br />Let me tell you, my family and friends are serious foodies.  We love to get together for special occasions and blow a paycheck on an excellent meal with good wines.  We all travel, and are the types to try all the freaky foods you find in local markets in far away places (most recently Beijing's stinky tofu and fried scorpions).<br /><br />We were all floored.  The lamb was fantastic.  It is a quick meal: you just take your racks, salt and pepper them, brown them in olive oil and butter, set them in your roaster, slather them with dijon mustard and then breadcrumbs, then roast at 375 for 20 minutes.  Easy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cookbook.  The recipes are easy to make, and are truly the classic recipes, but cut down in time and process to make it doable at home.  This is the type of recipe that is quick to make and could be whipped up for special occasions or an impressive business dinner.  Get this book.time and process to make it doable at home.

Dead bodies are found in an upscale apartment - people brutally tortured and murdered.  Then there are additional deaths, and homes are torn apart by someone searching for something.<br /><br />A person connected to the victims dies of a heart attack in Trinidad, and someone is trying to steal his yacht from his widow, Beth.  This leads to a chase around the West Indies as Wolfe is drawn into the case.  A bunch of black hats get killed along the way, but those are spear carriers.  The main villain walks away clean (except he loses what he was looking for).<br /><br />Beth and Wolfe acquire some interesting allies along the way, but they find that they have to be careful who they trust.  There are a lot of technical details about sailing mixed in with explicit sex and some amount of violence.  Overall it is an interesting story as various details of the case come to light.	2005-09-11

Filby (a world-renowned scholar, bibliographer, cryptologist, and genealogist) is once again available. Primarily based on the holdings of the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library, Filby also drew upon published state bibliographies and lists of county histories furnished by librarians in each state.

US	36572416	RPSPGSQN1ETDA	019511504X	527679427	A Short History of the World	Books	5	55	56	N	N	An amazing book	Reading this book was an incredible experience for me. Roberts gives a narrative of human history starting with evolution through the end of the 20th century -- and manages to do it in 15 chapters that average a little over 30 pages apiece. The result was that I was able to absorb the broad sweep of history in a little over two weeks. <br /> <br />The main caveat of this book is that its title may be somewhat misleading. Roberts's focus is very much on Western history, although to be fair, in the introduction he a) acknowledges this and b) makes a case to justify it -- so I don't think he's trying to sneak anything past the reader. <br /> <br />So if you can accept that it is quite Western-focused, it really is a great book. I basically felt that I was able to cover all the history I should have learned in school but didn't in a little over 500 pages.	2005-09-11

This first novel by R.K. Narayan details the adventures of a rather obstinate boy named Swaminithan.  His \"chums\" include the usual mix: the bully, the brain, the leader, etc..., and the developing relationships between them accounts for a substantial chunk of the plot.  After making friends with the new kid in town, Swami gets involved in a fraudulent financial scheme, quits school (repeatedly), and eventually runs away from home to escape his teacher's torments and his father's displeasure.  Although his parents surely love their son very much, they, like most other adults, are rather shadowy figures in this book.  The day to day challenges of school (both academic and social) are by far the most important facets of this boy's life.<br /><br />In short, there's a great deal about this book that will be familiar to Western readers despite the exotic setting.  Highlights include the time Swami gets caught up in a day of political protest that winds up trashing the school, and the time Swami runs away from home and has to face the terrible tiger.  Less enjoyable is the section that deals with cricket, a sport that has absolutely no fascination for this reader and very little for the most of the world outside of India.  Still, Narayan's style is just about impeccable; warm, soothing, and gently comic, with a fine understanding of human nature, and an easy acceptance of human weakness.  It's not Narayan's best book (the plot could be tighter) but it's a very good starting point for someone who's just discovering this fine writer.	2005-09-11

Islam is about violence, lies and destroying the true people of god (christians and jews).

The Crusades were a defensive war to save christian civilization from islamic slavery.   <br /> <br />As in earlier books, such as \"inside Islam\", Robert Spencer compares the violence satanic language of Muhammed to the truth of Christ which shows the lie that Islam has anything to do with \"people of the book\". <br /> <br />Robert Spencer is a great man who has helped bring many muslims to the truth of Christianity.

He explores the manner in which certain Nazi-era museum directors, art dealers, art journalists and art historians, and, finally, artists, themselves, negotiated the dangerous terrain of Hitler Germany in order to enjoy the benefits of Reich approval.  Petropoulos keeps the reader aware of moral, ethical, and legal issues as he paints a damning portrait of opportunists, both talented and not, who sold their souls to the National Socialist devil.  In the end, one is left with a sorrow for their choices, and, in all honesty, a realization that the art produced for this regime was weak, coarse, and ultimately foolish.	2005-09-10

I have several of Rosnak's nonfiction works, but from what I'd read about Flicker, it sounded pretty trivial. It's not. The book covers a lot of ground both about films & the film industry & about our culture in general. It's a good introduction to several different approaches to film criticism, & in that way has made films a lot more interesting to me. But aside from that, it's a good, fast moving drama with a lot of suspense & interest, but very little or none of the usual drivel: murders, romance, etc.  (There are some sex scenes, but not like any others I've ever read! I don't want to spoil it by trying to explain.) It's just a good thought-provoker that left me with more understanding of what goes on in movies & some good chuckles about the incredible foolishness that people seem to waste their lives on. It seems to me that Rszak did a great job of putting some of his ideas about society & technology into an exciting thriller of a novel.	2005-09-10

Everything I've read about it made it seem awfully confused and dull.  Besides, the war was won in the Pacific and Europe.  Mr. Webster has effectively related the drama and struggles of this exotic theater in a gripping and very readable narrative.  The Burma Road is a very good book and it really brings the cast of characters who make up the China-Burma-India theater to vivid life.  The exploits of General Stilwell are awe-inspiring as are the exciting and frightful battles fought by the special forces units of Wingate's Chindits and Merrill's Marauders.  The book is a fantastic overview of the entire theater throughout the war.  Webster tends to gloss over the struggles of actually building the Burma Road, however.  For example, in the beginning of the book the road is described as costing one man per mile.  But Mr. Webster fails to give us a clear understanding of how and why all these men died to build the Burma Road.  More detail on the enormous obstacles the engineers were faced with and overcame would have made the book more definitive.  Nevertheless, The Burma Road by Donovan Webster has finally brought this previously dark and unknown theater to stark and vivid light.	2005-09-10

I spent some time comparing two bread machine cookbooks as I recently purchased a Zojirushi BBC-X20 bread machine and wanted some recipes besides the ones in the manual that came with the machine. This was one; the other was \"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook\" by Beth Hensperger.<br /><br />This book is really a dazzling array of recipes and I like the fact that there are many that include unusual combinations and unusual grains like millet. There are also a large number of interesting ethnic bread recipes. Recipes are given for 1, 1.5 and 2lb loaves, but I will probably only use the 2lb amounts.<br /><br />The recipes are good and the price makes it a good value. It is a hardcover book, which is nice for durability's sake. My biggest gripe is the layout. I might not have been bugged by it, but Beth Hensperger's book is a visual delight, so this one looks kind of cheap in comparison. These recipes are crammed onto the pages and there is nothing in the way of photos of the recipes, or even any real drawings. Perhaps, with 600 recipes, there just wasn't any room for niceties.<br /><br />That may be a small thing and the recipes are good. But when push came to shove, I went for the other book...I'll add this one to my collection later. If you can't afford that one or don't mind the visual issues--and many people may not--this is still an excellent collection of bread machine recipes.	2005-09-10

If it's tough to write a phenomenal novel, this novel `reduction,' all the components reduced to their most basic and delicious levels, is surely a reading piece de resistance.  The prose is effortlessly brilliant, the characters and their relationships works of art, particularly Lenny and George, the main characters.  The descriptions of settings and the way they're used to set mood are mental beacons of clarity and brightness.  The use of foreshadowing, SOMETHING bad is going to happen, causes a most compelling tension in the reader.  In particular, the relationship of George and Lenny, which follows the unstated male rules about explaining or defining relationships between men, needs not an iota more from Steinbeck to be manifestly candid.

However, I've tracked Buzan's work for sometime, and used mindmapping to great effect in many aspects of my life.  (If you've ever fumbled through public speaking with 3X5 cards, a mind map will make you a much better speaker.)  As for \"spurious claims\" and \"pseudoscience\", in absence of any specific evidence for those assertions a reader would be foolish to believe the previous review.  Do we know enough about the brain to make all the claims Buzan makes?  Probably not.  But as with all the criticisms of Brain Based Teaching and Learning methods, you would be a foolish teacher if you were to wait around for definitive proof.  You might equate it to the arguments over global warming.  Ok, maybe the science to support all the doomsday scenarios of G.W. is a bit overblown.  But to ignore it and expect it to go away is insanity.  Mind Mapping is a terrific method of organizing information that has been used effectively in the business world in one form or another for years.  As we are visually centric creatures, it only makes sense to get a view of the big picture.  Buzan's method and mind mapping in general aren't about kids thinking more, or thinking harder.  They are about thinking smarter.  And the empirical evidence is there to prove it.  Bells and whistles and what not aside, using mindmaps with kids, where appropriate, is just good practice.	2005-09-10

Not for a moment was I lost or uncertain and I felt safe within its structure, reading hungrily even when I cried hard, hoping my children riding in the back seat and my husband (driving) wouldn't see either.   <br /> <br />The writer's language is torturously poetic in some places and brutally blunt and candid in others, urging me to consider things I hadn't before simply by placing myself in the position of those from whom Anjou gathered census material before she fired her personal questions at them.   <br /> <br />But the personal impact the story had on me is somewhat beside the point.  Reading it, I was aware of how the writer's sense of place was dead-on, the paradox of an idyllic suburban town that seems lost and found in its reliable ways; how her intimate knowledge of her characters and their relationship to Anjou, their effect on her and hers on them, made for one of the most compelling books I've read in years.  The personification of Anjou's unusual dog, Lurch, was a refreshing change from the kind of Disney-esque rendering of dogs in stories.  <br /> <br />Ms. Goldner has my admiration and respect for her lyricism and storyteling and her ability to provoke more than just thought.	2005-09-10

Antinomy revolves around two characters without names: the Other, who experiences difference, rejection, and learning through suffering; and the One, who experiences understanding, bliss, and cultivates a firm and holistic character. Act Two observes the descent of One and experience with human needs. The final act reveals the Divine Mind through a conversation between the One and the Other, who both understand their mutual dependence. An impressive and thought-provoking debut novel of complementary states of mind and being from a philosophy and literature student of eighteen years' experience.	2005-09-10

I can not be really objective, being born in Leningrad and living there for the first 20 years of my life. So, reading the \"Ice road\" returned me to the good - and not so good - old times in Russia. But this is not the only, and not even the main reason for me to enjoy the book. First of all, it is a real story. Well, it is real in a sense, that this story truly has happened to many people - and all of them had to go through grief, losses, betrayal, doubts... and this was the system that broke the people down. Read the book, and you understand how it works - something that will help you to discover one of those infamous \"Russian mysteries\". <br />Secondly, I was truly amazed to see that Slovo, who never has been in Russia, was able to find the right words, to paint the right atmosphere and describe all these Soviet hard idealists better than most Soviet writers that I know. This is a very impressive thing to perform from South Africa.  <br />Bottom line? Highly recommended. If you want to read a really good book, which will make you both to turn the pages at 2am, to cry and to think, pick this one.  <br />	2005-09-10

Lofts gives each queen between 2-5 pages of treatment, highlighting the main events of lives we know about only through historical documents and hearsay. Most of the more interesting facts about the queens is omitted; Lofts generally sticks to her facts and does a good job doing so.  It is wonderful to have a ready reference, especially for some of the lesser known queens.  Sadly, though, Lofts repeats a few since disproven tales and even repeats some of the wilder ones as fact rather than speculation.  Lofts also has some facts incorrect, such as stating that Mary Tudor was the born of the first pregnancy of Katherine of Aragon, when in fact she was at least the third pregnancy if not the fifth.  Still, the book is well-done, overall historically accurate, and absolutely gorgeous for its pictures.  If you're looking for depth, this isn't it; but if you are looking to be entertained while skimming a bit of history, this definitely fits the bill.	2005-09-10

It has always been a human proclivity to sacrifice freedoms for security in times of uncertainty but Franklin was right that \"those who woud sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither,\" and this is part of the philosphy that drives our V in \"V for Vendetta.\" It is interesting that many Britains today don't do much with Guy Falkes day and that Britain has been secure enough in the past decades that many in the current generations forget the type of sacrifices that their grandparents or great-grandparents went through to help defeat fascism. But Britain (and by proxy America) gained its stability by and sense of democracy through centuries of strife and bloodshed to bring about the freedoms that we cherish today. \"V for Vendetta\" reminds us that the old and trite truism that \"one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter,\" still has some bite even in a post-9/11 world and that one of the prices we pay for freedom is to constantly question our governments, the intent of our leaders, and our place in such a world... agree or disagree with V's methods, at least the graphic novel has the strength to make you think and ask, \" What would you do?\"	2005-09-10

(Alvin Hansen Symposium on Public Policy at Harvard University)	Books	5	23	25	N	N	The essential book in the "human capital" debate	This conversation/debate between two of the country's most distinguished economists focuses on one of the central questions in the design of social policy: How should government invest its resources in order to generate the biggest returns to the society? Should it focus mainly on very young children or should it underwrite a broad array of programs, from prenatal care through job training programs?  <br /> <br />\"Inequality in America\" isn't for everyone--the use of statistical analyses and technical language will scare off some readers--but for the policy wonk, broadly construed, this is essential reading. (Even the non-wonk who is willing to do some hard intellectual work can learn a great deal.)The book is structured, not as a \"two ships passing in the night\" pair of arguments but rather as a series of point-counterpoint discussions; the authors offer no-holds-barred criticisms of one another's arguments, sometimes in acidic language (with commentators adding additional perspectives). This structure adds considerably to its value, for readers are provided with enough evidence and analysis to reach an informed conclusion.  <br /> <br />My intellectual preferences generally run to the ethnographic rather than the economic, to contextualized narratives/cases rather than number-crunching, to work more readily accessible to a broader audience. But this is a powerful exception: I learned more from \"Inequality in America\" than from anything I've read in a long time. <br /> <br />	2005-09-10

Step-right-up and get your piece of vengeance, in REVENGE GIFTS by Cindy Cruciger. It is a flawless 5 hearts and a must read for 2005!<br /><br />Tara Cole is single, white and over twenty-one. She runs a highly popular and forever-in-use, Revenge-Gifts.com. The art of revenge is her specialty and she is darn proud of it! Tara had come up with this idea after she got her own revenge toward her former IBM boss Aileen, who was pencil-thin and addicted to chocolate. Tara had Godiva chocolates delivered right to Aileen's desk for six straight months, until Aileen ballooned up an extra thirty pounds. This is now Tara's best seller on Revenge-Gifts.com---Candy-A-Day.<br /><br />With all of her good luck, wouldn't you know something bad had to happen and it does in the form of Howard Payne. He is one, tall drink of water, whose underwear are a little too tight (meaning he is conservative). He is interested in investing in Tara's company, but Tara has her suspicions and is waiting for the ball to drop, so to speak. These two will engage in a little fancy footwork, until Howard starts to show his true colors. What will Tara do when the reality slaps her in the face? It's a legitimate question (you'll understand that remark, when you read the book). Knowing Tara she will, more than likely, slap it back. Along the way, Tara has gotten gris-gris bags, a menagerie of black animals, and is being haunted; maybe there is something to that karma thing after all.<br /><br />REVENGE GIFTS is by Cindy Cruciger. This book is all about poetic justice in the form of innocent-like gifts, sent through Revenge-Gifts.com and what you do to others might come back to you in the most unexpected ways.

It doesn't go into a whole lot of mumbo jumbo but goes right into the point. The explanations are very clear and an important learning tool it uses (which is a formula most authors should know by now) is it does give example codes that work correctly, for most of the book. <br /> <br />Another good thing about this book is it does give you insights about certain topics. The author does tell you important concepts as to why a certain language feature/construct is the way it is as well as mistakes/flaws in the language. <br /> <br />It is definitely one of the better Java books out there.	2005-09-10

The worst part is that the author makes you SUFFER through endless, obvious, and repetitive \"clues\" that the main character keeps ignoring.  The \"evil\" old people living in the apartment building are soooooo over-the-top evil that you expect them to finish each sentence with \"Mu-ha-ha-ha\".  For example, in nearly all of the chapters of the book, some evil old lady brings \"strange tasting\" cookies/candy/or fudge for the children to eat(daily), but insists that the mother NOT try any (\"it isn't good for your figure deary\"...Mu-ha-ha-ha).  The kids eat the fudge, get loopy and go to bed at like 5PM.  At the stroke of midnight (because that's when crappy stories get spooky) the kids proceed to have \"dreams\"  that the old people in the building are standing in their bedrooms touching them inappropriately (no joke) - Oh, and saying subtle things like \"Shhh,  I think she's awake.  Quick, give her some more fudge!  Mu-ha-ha-ha\".  The mother doesn't get suspicious until the old people in the building (totally serious...no joke) tie her to a bed and dope her up for several days. Ok, hold on because even then, she still wants to give them the \"benefit of the doubt\".  When one of the immortal old people finally gets killed, he immediately decomposes.  Can you imagine?  What an original idea.	2005-09-10

They are all shown quite large (It's a tall book).  Of course, the paintings themself are beautiful.  Unlike other books that I have seen, a significant portion of this book is dedicated to Wyeth's paintings of cowboys and the American West.  Of course, paintings depicting the adventure from stories like Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Last of the Mohicans and others are included too.  A few still life and landscape paintings are also included.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book seems to be out of print, so I recommend getting it while you can.  Hopefully, someone will decide to compile a set of books with quality color images of all of N.C. Wyeth's paintings.  Until then, this book does a reasonable job.	2005-09-09

The bad guys are bad, some of  the good guys used to be bad, and we continue to see the same smart-ass one liners that Spenser and Hawk come up with.  I'm always in a better mood when I read a Spenser novel; the fast pacing and wisecracking just keep me going.  The friend who turned me on to this series has the same trait.  He named one of his sons Spenser, he likes the series so much.  I read this one over a period of 4 days.  It paints a smarmy image of corporate politics points to an \"Enron\"-like company as the source of a group of high management people who are involved in a sex  swap group activity as a way to \"free\" themselves.  I think this part of the plot was contrived, but I still enjoyed the fast pace and Spenser and CO. dealing with it.

These Oxford Catholic scholars which included Cardinal Gregory Martin were professed Roman Catholics who refused to submit to authority that Queen Elizabeth I was the head of the Church of England. Cardinal Gregory Martin was also a former Oxford associate and personal friend of St. Edmund Campion (the Jesuit saint who was butchered into pieces alive in England for being a Catholic priest).<br /><br />Here is an excellent and good example of the Douay Rheims translation.  St. Luke 1:28 says, \"Hail full of grace, the Lord is with you\".  The KJV Authorised Version says, \"Hail favored one, the Lord is with you\".  The New American Bible and the Jerusalem Bible says the same thing like the KJV Authorised Version.  The former Bibles are Catholic Bibles while the latter is a Protestant one!  What is even worse, the NAB and KJV Authorised Verison were translated by Protestants!  Pope Paul VI even states that the former was translated by heretics in his letter of introduction regarding the NAB.<br /><br />The original Latin translation based on the Hebrew word-for-word says, \"Ave gratia plena, dominus tecum\".  \"Ave gratia plena\" translates as either \"Hail full of grace or \"Hail filled with grace\".  The Protestant scholars translated out the real verse on St. Luke 1:28 because they believed it was only reference to the Catholic prayer, \"Hail Mary\" at the same time changing the biblical importance and meaning of the verse regarding the Virgin Mary.  The meaning of \"full of grace\" means that the Blessed Virgin was conceived without the stain of original sin.<br /><br />How can a Catholic defend the infallible dogma of Our Lady's Immaculate Conception with faulty Catholic Bible translations like the New American Bible or the Jerusalem Bible?  How can our Faith be defended by the attacks of enemies Our Church?  The Rosary is biblically associated with the Bible and how can we defend the prayer \"Ave Maria\" with these faulty translations.<br /><br />Non-Catholic churches such as the Eastern Orthodox church translate St. Luke 1:28 correctly like the Catholic Bible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most Catholic Bibles like the New American Bible (NAB) were translated by Protestant scholars (with the exception of the RSV: Catholic Edition which translated St. Luke 1:28 to the original version).<br /><br />Using \"Thou\" and \"Thee\" may be a serious obstacle to many Catholic readers of the Bible.  Logically, would you rather read a Bible that you can understand but it is not giving you the real and full meaning of what it is saying or rather you read a Bible that you cannot understand but it gives you the real and full meaning of what it is saying?<br /><br />The Douay-Rheims had been a reliable Bible translation for more than 500 years until 1941 with the publication of the Confraternity Version.  The Douay Rheims Bible had only one revision in 1742 by the Apostolic Vicar of London, Bishop Richard Challoner.  The King James Authorised Version had numerous revisions and editing because of the poor translation given by its Protestant scholars.  In fact, the Douay Rheims Bible's English was updated to the English used in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Servant of God, Bishop Richard Challoner.  The 1611 King James Authorised Verison was never edited after its publication and it is far more archaic in its English translation than the Douay Rheims.<br /><br />Like the King James Bible, reading the Douay Rheims enhances your reading skills and your English vocabulary whether you are British or an American because the Douay Rheims is truly a British English translation.  You will hear or read words that you will never see in modern translated Bibles such as these words:<br /><br />1.  Anathema<br />2.  Sundry<br />3.  Husbandry<br />4.  Husbandman<br />5.  Brethren<br />6.  Heretic<br />7.  Schism<br />8.  Heresy<br /><br />The commentary of this Bible entirely and 100% Catholic without Modernist influence or heretical teachings.  If you want a Douay Rheims Bible with much more commentary for the Biblical verses, I suggest for you to buy the Haydock Bible of the Douay Rheims Bible.  It is about $100 but with extensive and verse-to-verse commentary on the Bible.  It really helps and is excellent for helping you understanding the Bible.<br /><br />Avoid modern Catholic Bibles translated with Modernist errors and commentary.  These Bible spread heretical commentaries and teachings.  Modernism is a heresy that was condemned by Pope St. Pius X in 1907.

After reading this book (and I know I'm going to draw fire on this one), it's clear to me that the American Democrats are the political descendants of the Revolutionary War Patriots, and the Republicans of the Tories/Loyalists. I'll tell you why below.<br /><br />This book is about those Americans before and during the Revolutionary War who did not want to divorce themselves from the King of England. These were of course mostly the rich and powerful - those who had most to lose by a change in the status quo.<br /><br />What happened to them is the gripping tale that is the focus of this book. The author paints in vivid and minute details as he tells the stories of countless colonial Americans who refused to become \"patriots\": where they went to keep safe, how they were punished if caught, what happened to them after the war, how obsequious they were to the British in charge - and how these British despised them as much as they did any other American.<br /><br />One very interesting point made: the masses turned neither Patriot nor Loyalist. Reminds me of Americans to this day, most of whom are neither Republican nor Democrat - or at least not strongly enough to take action one way or the other. Like their Loyalist fathers before them, rich and powerful Americans today flock to the Republican Party. They hate change. Why shouldn't they?  One sometimes suspects that many would gladly chuck democracy, if that's what it would take to keep their power.	2005-09-09

Here are a couple of highlights I took away.<br /><br />Notwithstanding their popularity among certain politically-minded religious fanatics, the leading lights of the ID movement, Behe and Dembski, have published little to nothing in peer-reviewed journals in the areas of their alleged scientific expertise. One would rightly expect better from men who claim to have overturned the last 14 decades of progress in the biological sciences.<br /><br />ID proponents deploy false and misleading analogies. They propose false dilemmas. They press their \"findings\" while ignoring contrary evidence. They abuse terms and muddle definitions in the service of their preferred outcomes. These are not the behaviors of real scientists.<br /><br />If you're interested in whether ID proponents truly commit these errors, read this book and see for yourself. The authors, all credentialed scientists, demonstrate the errors clearly and cogently.<br /><br />If God exists, he survived Copernican heliocentrism, and he'll survive Darwinian evolution. Any actual God can withstand the contemplation of reality as the evidence actually reveals it to be. This book represents an excellent step toward science and reality and away from zealotry and superstition.	2005-09-09

To read a play is to be faced with the power of dialogue to make or break a story. In Amadeus, author Peter Shaffer uses the spoken word to full effect. He takes a sand-grain of historical truth and lets it build in layers to the pearl it becomes in fiction. In this story, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, future legend and his own lifetime the most celebrated composer in late-18th century Vienna, turns out compositions of sheer genius, almost, it seems to his rival, the mediocre Antonio Salieri, without effort. Salieri is a man who has risen from modest beginning to reach his post of court composer to the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, and he recognizes in the earthy, profane Mozart, a superior, though in his regard undeserving talent. Where Saleri is devout, Mozart is licentious. Where Saleri must strain for hours to compose a small lackluster tune, Mozart extemporaneously flings celebrated music at the world. What begins as intoxicated admiration of Salieri toward the younger newcomer ripens to darkest envy and eventually to hatred. Salieri vows to destroy Mozart and punish God for making a creature of hedonistic depravity the instrument of Heavenly music. Salieri, once God's most obedient, modest servant turns into a conniving, plotting caricature of his former self. He stalks Mozart and awaits his chance to strike his revenge. In this way, by being universally known as Mozart's murderer, Salieri has confidence that in the end he will defeat God by forever linking his name to Mozart's--a victim and his destroyer. In this way he will share in the fame God in His gift gave Mozart. And yet, there is one last twist to Shaffer's story, for it is after all God Salieri is challenging here, not merely the flesh and blood Mozart, and in the closing seconds of the final act, it is God who plays the final hand to very crafty effect.nal hand to very crafty effect.	2005-09-09

I was amazed with the detailed instruction and all the photos and illustrations.  JKD is tough to learn from a book, but I was amazed at how thorough the instruction was.  I was surprised a book could demonstrate techniques this well.  The pictures are sequential to show the moves.  This book, either alone or combined with instruction will help students of JKD to bring his/her skills to the next level (or two). <br /> <br />I like how the author acknowledged in the beginning that the book is based on his own interpretation of Bruce Lee's teachings.  He seemed to take the teachings of many and blend it into what he interprets to be the best of all teachings.  He notes \"...do not become a product of this book\" to encourage readers to learn from the book then develop their own style.   <br /> <br />When I went to purchase the book for myself and saw that it was around $25, I was positively blown away.  Since I've already bought it (in case the author takes my advice) I can honestly say that I would have paid double and still been satisfied with my purchase.	2005-09-09

It came close around Caen. <br /> <br />Churchill had a different agenda, as d'Este reveals: he did not want troops withdrawn from Italy for the invasion of Southern France, he wanted a thrust across the Alps into Austria. <br /> <br />Churchill was always a side-show man.	2005-09-09

This is still a very important work on the topic of Roman Republican history.  However, that being said, John H. Collins' abridgement of Mommsen's three volumes into a six-hundred page book published by Meridian in 1958 is the book that should be sought out.  It is generally available here on Amazon from used book dealers in the fifteen to twenty-five dollar range. It covers the period from the end of the Punic Wars to the demise of the Republic.  The translation is thoroughly lively and accurate and makes the work accessible and engaging and retains the stunning quality of Mommsen's writing as great literature.  The greatest strength of Mommsen's work was in the period after two-hundred fifty BCE.  The Meridian edition both in paperback or hardcover is a magnificent read and covers almost all of the most important of Mommsen's contributions to Roman Republican history.<br /><br />The cover art appearing above is from the Meridian paperback not the book being reviewed here.  At 10.2 pounds and 1703 pages, this Routledge item is a beautiful example of fine printing and high quality binding.  It also appears that certain reissue publishers are now making the complete work available but as four volumes and with less pages and weight.  That will mean smaller print and lower quality paper.  I own a 1908 edition of the complete work in English, and the only reason I suggest that one would want a copy of the complete work would be if they were involved with the intellectual history of \"classical\" scholars.  Compared with Alan Ward's, \"History of the Roman People,\" the current standard \"textbook\" on Roman History, Mommsen's work is historically fresh and vital and, yes, generally accurate after one hundred and fifty years.  The unabridged work won the Nobel prize for literature in 1902 - The only history book to ever win the prize.

The only things I do not like are that there is poor grammar and sentence structure. For example:'\"What happend to us?\" Said Annie.' Instead of 'said Annie' it should be 'asked Annie'. (The main reason I'm telling you this is because I know that it bothers some people to read books with poor grammar in them to thier child/children) If things like that annoy you, you may want to look into another series, but if they don't then you might really enjoy these books. Oh, and this book is only 68 pages long.

When they climb up the tree house they find lots of books. When they see a book about dinosaurs and Jack wishes he could see a Pteranodon for real it takes them to the time of dinosaurs. They see a Pteranodon, a Triceratops, an Anatosauruse, and a Tyrannosaurus rex (T-rex). Jack finds a gold medalian with the letter 'M' on it, and neither Jack nor Annie can figure out what the 'm' stands for. (I am telling you this because, although it may not sound like it, it is important.)You have to read the book yourself to find out how they get back home.<br /><br />I hope my review has helped you :)	2005-09-09

This book is a joy-filled description of his early life and formation as a nature-lover. We hear of the wild beauty of Canada, the Quixotic plans his father devised and his mother endured, and the daring adventures which will become the foundation for his later writings. Although a light-hearted story overall, Farley does not avoid the difficult times, including a powerful depiction of the effect of the Depression on the Canadian provinces. It is a love song to the strength of character and perseverence of our northern cousins, as well.<br /><br />When the book ends, the reader, like the writer, wonders if there will ever be such a wonderful time again. Sheer delight.	2005-09-09

Without knowing how to even pronounce the author's name, I bought the book and went home. I hadn't any idea what I held, and so had no preconceptions about the precious quality of Proust's work. I began reading it that night, in my room at the top of the house, in cool retreat from the hot summer evening. Before I finished the second page, I realized what I had done. Mistakenly stumbled upon a genius. No one had mentioned this man to me. I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />I can't comment upon the translation for two reasons: I don't read French, and this is the only version I've read. But I'm happy in my narrow ignorance; I choose to believe that those are Proust's very words, and I see him in every sentence. In an age of succinct and imageless writing, where everyone is suspicious of sounding too pretentious or distant, I subsist on on his beautiful, metaphor-laden, and verbose prose. Proust is a master at what modern writers fear, dwelling on a sentence for pages without losing sight of meaning or the reader.<br /><br />Yes, it does require some effort at first: this is no potboiler. And what is it about, exactly? The most succinct answer I can conjure is: nostalgia. That is, an old man trying to recapture his past, himself, and the significance of everything. I suppose that makes this also rather autobiographical, since Proust noted that he only began to write, really, once he had acquired enough experience.<br /><br />This is the first installment of what would become a 3,000 page epic, so it probably shouldn't be entered into lightly. But it will not be regretted.	2005-09-09

His reading isn't much better and please forget that he has a British accent (the only valid reason for getting the gig) - It is forced, and he over-compensates for the lack of clarity in his 'luvvy', sometimes pompous, \"I am an actor\" drone.<br />His HP version isn't a patch on Stephen Fry's.

Books	5	8	9	N	N	Good Book	In this volume, Talbott argues that the practice of securing a broad range of human rights would dramatically increase the well-being of the world's citizens, present and future.  Moreover, and more interestingly, he argues that this increase provides the underlying justification for such rights.  His position is a novel addition to the contemporary scene, dominated by non-consequentialist approaches like those of Rawls.  Talbott clearly and effectively challenges Rawls's position in The Law of Peoples and, on the way, offers fascinating historical illustrations of moral progress and the psychological mechanisms that sustain or inhibit it.   His response to Richard Rorty in the last chapter is also worth reading, although I found it somewhat less convincing.	2005-09-08

I give Webster's 4 stars instead of 5 because they have not updated since 1961, but they likely never will.  That said, I consider this as invaluable as the Oxford English and several other dictionaries I own or use.  Each has it's purpose.  I own this one because, when power goes down, it is accessible, as well as historically accurate.  I usually access it online, though, through the internet; which, another reviewer notes, you will not find defined within it.  If I want an absolutely up-to-date dictionary, online is the only recourse. [...] That's a specialized purpose, since one would hardly be able to read most of literature with only the most current dictionary -- hence the value of Webster's.  Webster's is as \"Old School\" as it gets.  Wiktionary is as \"New School\" as it gets.  The world needs both.  Get Webster's because you may never see that form of unabridged dictionary ever again, unless civilization literally collapses around us.  In either case, the value will rise over time.	2005-09-08

As Spott points out, the truth is that Nazism, like all self-styled utopianisms, was something like a gigantic project in aesthetics using people rather than pigments or plastics, and control and murder rather than downstrokes and glazing - and Hitler was the artist behind that (very popular for some years in Germany) project; he therefore must be taken seriously as an artist in this sense (obviously a grotesque, genocidal one).<br /><br />As Spotts notes, even his hatred of Jews emerges from this context: the Jews are \"ruining all art\" by embracing atonalism, cubism, jazz, dadaism, etc., as well as ruining all life by embracing \"Bolshevism\". But in his mind, there doesn't seem to be much difference there: Picasso, Marx, Alban Berg - all the same. Since, in Hitler's view, art can't be separated from culture, and culture can't be separated from the state, and the state can't be separated from life itself, the eradication of the Jews becomes, in Hitler's mind, nothing less than a matter of national survival, or, strangely, to say the same thing, the artistically appropriate choice.<br /><br />Spotts does a good job of underscoring another aspect of all this by calling attention to the seeming homoeroticism in Hitler's taste, particularly as it expresses itself toward the human being: at bottom (pun intended), Hitler preferred, aesthetically, buff blond males with blue eyes, i.e., \"Nordic\" types. The Jews, in addition to being greedy, \"Bolsheviks\", destroyers of art/culture/life, etc., just...looked \"wrong\". And so in this sense, in Hitler's mind, ridding the proper-looking race of these improper-looking portions of it was as obviously a necessary decision as would be getting rid of a \"wrong\" piece of furniture cluttering up an otherwise beautiful living room. (Spotts even includes a contemporary German cartoon caricaturing the physical features of a \"typical\" Jew).<br /><br />But what I started out to say was this. Spotts surveys how Hitler very consciously used colour, shape, rhetoric, size, proportion, angle, material, sound, light, symbol, rhythm, story, pageantry, texture, surprise, music, fire, sculpture, formation, etc., to, quite literally, achieve a truly terrifying degree of control over the minds of his subjects, even as a conversion tool over those who had resisted him. (Spotts describes how awed even American visitors were by the Nuremberg rallies.)<br /><br />And page by page, one begins increasingly to get a sense of what it would have been like, to be a human being, subject to all the mental and emotional strengths and weaknesses we are, living in a country (our world, for all purposes) which only a year or two before had been totally chaotic and depressed...and then to be stirred, roused, when that world around us begins to change, prompted to feel different, pleasurable things, think different, exciting thoughts, and in the end, perform different - and ultimately - indescribably horrific actions. In every way, we are preyed upon by the mesmeric, sick genius of a man who was rejected by the art school in Vienna, and who sought his revenge for this affront by dominating human psychology through all those elements I mentioned above more totally than perhaps any other \"artist\" of the 20th century.<br /><br />I saw a BBC documentary a couple of weeks ago, in which several elderly Germans candidly recalled with fondness Hitler's early years. What they said they missed most were the euphoric feelings they had, going to the pageants and rallies, seeing the flags, hearing the speeches and the music, those feelings of belonging, meaning, \"specialness\". And for the first time, reading Spotts' book, in a really disturbing way, I could imagine what that might have been like, imagine that I might have been just as susceptible to the manipulator as millions of Germans had been. For the first time, how the whole thing could have happened seemed imaginable. Scary.<br /><br />Bravo to Spotts for his brilliant and disturbing book. I would love to see him now do a documentary on this, using real footage.<br /><br />Highly recommended.potts' book, in a really disturbing way, I could imagine what that might have been like, imagine that I might have been just as susceptible to the manipulator as millions of Germans had been.

When I read it last a couple of weeks ago, it finally started to fall apart (paperback).  But hardback copies are available used, so I was able to replace it easily.  Here's the story.  A young American in Ireland to visit relatives falls in love with a beautiful young woman on a train.  They consumate their sudden love on a Ferry boat, a leg of his jouney.  She had never revealed her name.  In the morning he finds her gone with no way of tracing her.  He finds her under incredible circumstances, but burdened by her guilt over their illicit interlude, she refuses to acknowledge or return his love.  When she is found to be pregnant, he is unable to claim his child.  The author felt duty bound to include historical politics which is irrelevant to the plot.

I was very disappointed. I can appreciate that the author likes puns (yes, I identified the Beatles songs/lyrics), but they seemed heavy-handed.  <br /> <br />In addition, although I realize that some suspension of disbelief is often called for when reading historical romances or the paranormal, some things just grated on my nerves. For example, if I read correctly, the story takes place around 1829, but the author uses quotes from Thoreau. He would have been 10. A character quotes a passage from Yeats' poem \"When You Are Old\"; Yeats was born in 1865 (there is at least one other reference to Yeats). The main character records pigs with a \"new-fangled recording device\"; were there any in the early 1800s? I don't think so. There are other time problems in the text. <br /> <br />Overall, I think the author was just too amused at herself and her \"witty\" plays on words. I found the book sloppy overall.

Welsh is a complex language that has an extensive use of auxiliary verbs, a complex system for the verb 'to be', a well-developed system of mutations, etc.  Most books handle all this poorly.  This book is focused more on conversational Welsh than literary Welsh (which is much more complicated).  This book, however, does deal with aspects of the language that are not in the realm of conversation.  It offers many examples and much practise on the CDs.

But his old ultraegotistical boozing ways lands him him a murder one arrest warrant when his psychic, Madam Endora Crystal is murdered. The only person who believes that he's not capable of killing is a fan of his soul, Karen Bayliss, a woman that brought him to Christ through a fan letter.<br /><br />Kansas christian, Karen Bayliss's soul want let her give up on the ugliest soul she's ever encountered, alternative rockband, Deathstroke's lead singer, Everett Lester. Little does she kow that his psychic, Endora wants his soul, too. But it is up to Everett to decided who he wants to believe in.<br /><br />Creston Mapes weaves this tale from past to present without making the reader gag from all the flashbacks. In fact, the flashback is more than just backstory, it is The Story, our story, a redemption story. How does a God hating unbeliever, find and adore God? How does someone full of excess find that he is just as destitute as his poorest fan? And how one person--Karen Bayliss--can save a man's life.<br /><br />This novel is more than a mystery/court room novel. Mapes threw in a kidnapping, demonization, a suicide attempt, a romance and two Rolling Stone interviews to keep it interesting.<br /><br />I've talked about this book before, in regards to how Mapes uses nonfiction techniques to connect with his readers. Everett's thoughts about how could God exist, and why many don't believe in God anymore--add more realism and incite to this series. Although I thought the dialogue at times didn't push the story along, I understood why it was necessary for readers to see Everett's transformation and his band members and the media's struggle with believeing that Everett's Jesus talk wasn't just \"foxhole religion.\"<br /><br />Moreover, this book is a testament to the power of intercessory prayer. Every Saturday one of my girl friend's, holds an intercessory prayer meeting at our other galpal's church. I have told myself that I was too busy to go until I read the book.

ISBN: 1-57731-480-8. Paperback, 235 pages.<br /><br />The Power of Now has been a #1 New York Times bestseller. An endorsement by Oprah Winfrey helped to increase sales, and over two million copies have been sold. The author, Eckhart Tolle, was born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. He does not claim to be a member of any specific religion. He uses principles from Christianity and Buddhism, A Coarse in Miracles and The Bible. Tolle's message of the entire book appears in the title. The book is divided into ten chapters, plus the introduction. Tolle uses a question/answer format to anticipate reader reactions.<br /><br />From the beginning, Ekhart Tolle assures the readers that \"You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are!\"<br /><br />In chapter 1, Tolle states that \"you are not your mind\" and that the greatest obstacle to enlightenment is the mind. He claims that identifying with what's on our mind creates a barrier due to labels, images, and judgments that cross our consciousness. Tolle tells the reader to remember that \"you are one with all this is.\" In reference to this oneness, Tolle says that the mental movies complete with inner-voice soundtrack is a \"result of all your past history as well as of the collective cultural mind-set you inherited.\" Tolle encourages the reader to be in the here and now, to be alert and aware but not thinking, just like in meditation. He states that success with this practice can be measured by the degree of \"peace that you feel within.\" In order to achieve enlightenment, Tolle tells the reader to \"rise above thought.\" Simply \"say yes to life, and see how life suddenly starts working.\"<br /><br />In chapter 2, Tolle tells the reader how to recognize the ego, which feeds on external things, such as possessions and social status. Tolle ends the chapter by giving the reader a riddle: \"Death is a stripping away of all that is not you. The secret to life is to die before you die, and find that there is no death.\" The book cover states, \"Tolle uses simple language.\" The language may be simple, but the concept about the secret to life is complex. In other chapters, the principles are obvious: \"The more you are focused on time, past and future, the more you miss the now.\" Tolle gives the reader a powerful lesson on time: \"Any lesson from the past becomes relevant and is applied now. Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now.\" His book is a dichotomy of his beliefs: He tells readers to pause between chapters to mull over the concepts while telling us that our troubles arise because we think too much. He says we analyze too much, then tells us in chapter 4: \"Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation.\" Isn't that analyzing?<br /><br />Chapter 8 could cause controversy. Tolle says that \"women are closer to enlightenment\" than men because \"it is easier for a woman to feel and be in her body.\" Tolle dares to explore the menstrual cycles as painful due to the collective consciouness of being subjugated and exploited by men. Furthermore, Tolle states:\"The number of women who are now approaching the fully conscious state already exceeds that of men.\" How is that measured?<br /><br />Many books are written about the power of the present (versus reflecting on the past and/or planning for the future); about embracing the journey (versus focusing on the destination); and about enjoying the process (versus focusing on the product.) O: The Oprah Magazine endorses that this book can \"transform your thinking\" bringing the reader \"more joy, right now.\" The point is made in the title: The Power of Now.<br />review by Lynn C.

It is not like any other book. The short stories can relate to our life because it talks about selfishness, greed, and racism. I enjoyed reading this novel even though it was science fiction. This book contains a lot of imagery and scenery, which made this novel exciting. I liked this book because I read a lot of unexpected things, which made it more interesting.   <br /> My favorite quote was from the chapter, \" The Veldt.\" \"Children are carpets, they should be stepped on occasionally.\" This quote is true because parents who let their children get their own way, may become spoiled. If parents let their children take advantage of them, it will become a habit and they can get out of control. Children should be taught at a young age and should be raised properly.  <br /> I think this book should be required reading because there were many themes in the novel we all can learn from. Ray Bradbury's novel is filled with his imagination, which can take you on an adventure.  <br />	2005-09-08

There wasn't supposed to be an extra guitar player, so I came up to him and I said, 'Gee, is it okay if I play?' and he said 'Yea, yea, you can play.'  And I said, 'Well Chuck . . . ' and he said,  'What?' And I said, 'What songs are we going to do?'  And he said, 'Well, we're going to do some Chuck Berry songs.'  That's all he said.\" <br /> <br />Unlike just about every other celebrity autobiography, Chuck Berry wrote this book himself - and it is the better for it.  He wrote it and his beloved wife Toddy and his secretary Fran read the proofs.  No ghost writer penned this one under the strap line 'as told to . . .'  No 'creative editor' rearranged the words to fit a house style.  Charles Edward Anderson Berry wrote this book and he did so with the same zest, humour, poetry and soul he put into his songs.  I read all 360 pages in one sitting and it was so good, I have begun reading it all over again. <br /> <br />Berry grew up in an all-black neighbourhood and never saw a white man until the neighbour's shed burnt down and white firemen came to out the blaze.  \"Not knowing them to be Caucasian, I thought they were so frightened that their faces were whitened from fear of going near the big fire.\" <br /> <br />Music was baptist hymns with his mother Martha Banks Berry at the family piano.  Piano lessons and Beethoven gave way to the guitar and 'Roll Over Beethoven.' <br /> <br />Fifty years ago, Charles Berry gave Leonard Chess a demo tape of a song he had recorded at home called Ida May.  He had the idea that if he took a blues tune and put a speeded up 'hill-billy' (as C&W was then known) beat behind it, it would gain a wider appeal.  He had been playing to mixed audiences (i.e. black and white) and had noticed that some songs would get the one or the other crowd onto the dance floor, but speed up a blues tune to a country beatand they both hit the floor. <br /> <br />\"Free, black, twenty-one, single and unbelievably horny.\" is how Chuck Berry describes himself after three years jail for armed robbery.  He does not gloss over the mistakes or try to be something he was not.  It is written in the old-fashioned style of an educated black man from the South.  He speaks of \"the nobility of the moment\" on one page and \"I was sho nuff a family man\" on the next, as he moves effortlessly from being a Southern Gentleman one minute to a 'Yassir Boss!' negro the next, giving us a sly wink and poking fun at our attitudes to both. <br /> <br />Ida May was changed to Maybellene and on May 21st 1955, rock-and-roll was born.  \"It was just my attempt to sing country and Western, which I have always liked!\"  Mr. B (as Fran and his other employees called him) makes no claim to any special place in history.   <br /> <br />But he does quietly and skillfully put other claimants in their place:  \"In 1943 Big Joe Turner was appearing one night at the Rum Boogie nightclub in Chicago on 55th and South Parkway (now Dr. Martin L King Drive).  I climbed up to a window of the club where I saw and heard him sing 'Rock Around the Clock,' a tune Bill Haley copied ten years later.\" <br /> <br />In that one statement, he alludes to the common practise of white song smiths 'lifting' black tunes and becoming wealthy in the process. <br /> <br />One is given a clear idea of what it was like to be black back then and today.  The book begins with the birth of Cellie Wolfolk to Mistress Wolfolk, owner of the Wolfolk Plantation in Kentucky.  But Cellie's father was one of the house servants  <br />and little Cellie was \"a fair-skinned negro\" and therefore was born into slavery.  Cellie was Chuck Berry's great-grandmother. <br /> <br />Throughout the 360 pages there is always that underlying theme.  Whereas other nations may be defined by class or religion, Americans and the people of the southern states in particular are definedby the colour of their skin.  As a Scotsman, I have always been baffled by this obsession and Mr. Berry goes a long way to explain it.  Just one hundred years earlier, his great-grandmother was somebody's property.   <br /> <br />Is the book self-indulgent?  Yes (it is an autobiography after all!)  Did he have affairs?  Yes.  Does he try to hide it?  No, he even goes so far as to devote a couple of chapters to the more interesting girls he has known.  My wife assures me that Chuck Berry is one of the most interesting and good looking men she has ever seen,so I suppose it was inevitable.  I've been in the music business for some forty years and I have done the same, it's just that nobody wants to read about it!  But then I didn't create rock-and-roll, I am just one of the thousands that were swept up to become part of this giant industry that began over fifty years ago. <br /> <br />For one blinding moment, one brown eyed handsome man picked up the ultimate phallic symbol and thanks to an invention by Leo Fender, woke up the World.  Those tunes were covered and copied by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and every other rock band that ever followed them.  When I was a kid at college, we played Chuck Berry tunes.  We copied the open riffs to 'Johnny B Good,' 'Carol,' 'Queenie' and all the other songs note by  <br />note and beat by beat.  It's how we learnt to play rock-and-roll.    <br /> <br />Now, thanks to that industry, I own a recording studio in Scotland and we get to record music by people from all over the World.  And if I am honest, the songs may have other titles and other words, but all these years we have been doing Chuck Berry songs. <br />	2005-09-08

UNMASKED - Virginia Henley<br /><br />Signet<br /><br />ISBN: 0-451-21627-X<br /><br />September 2005<br /><br />Historical Romance<br /><br />Saint-Germain, France; Scotland; London, England - 1644 and 1657<br /><br />The domineering Oliver Cromwell rules England and no one is happy, especially those of the royal Stuart court.  Forced to bend to his will and adopt the less-than-luxurious lifestyle the Protectorate enforces - attending church three times a week, wearing dull garments, and having absolutely no fun whatsoever - London citizens are more than ready for their rightful monarch to be returned to his throne.  Change is in the air, and Charles II lies in wait, forced into exile after the murder of his father, Charles I.<br /><br />No one knows the hardship of exile in France better than Elizabeth \"Velvet\" Cavendish.  Raised by doting parents, Velvet now wears ratty clothes that barely fit, and is able to eat only enough to stay alive, yet she lives in anticipation of her beloved monarch returning to the throne of England.  Childhood friends, Velvet fondly recalls many good memories of the handsome Charles.  She fell in love with the then prince and prayed that he would marry her; and even as she nurses her ailing mother, Velvet holds on to that one great wish - to marry the man of her dreams, Charles.  Instead, she is betrothed to Robert Greysteel Montgomery, yet another friend to the Stuart prince.<br /><br />With a stroke of luck, Velvet is able to return to her beloved England under the tutelage of a distant relation, Christian Cavendish, the Dowager Countess of Devonshire.  Now Velvet may take up her rightful life as the daughter of an earl, and live accordingly.  Velvet is quite beautiful and is sure to ensnare some rich gent into marriage, but one man stands in her way - Greysteel Montgomery, who has returned to England as well.  Now a double agent, his greatest goal is to see Charles II back on the throne.  Greysteel cannot believe his eyes when he sees Velvet again.  He remembers the little hellion quite well, and is startled to see the girl has transformed into a stunningly sensuous woman.  By God, he'll have her or die trying...<br /><br />Oh what a tangled web we weave...  Greysteel wants Velvet and will stop at nothing to make her his.  Velvet cannot deny her passion for Greysteel, and that's when she becomes confused.  Her head tells her she wants Charles, but her body cries out for Greysteel.<br /><br />Virginia Henley's love for history shines in UNMASKED.  Velvet is more than a match for Greysteel, and Greysteel is just the man to tame Velvet and show her that her passionate nature can be better used than in battles of will.  Her time back on British soil is well spent, and Velvet becomes quite adept in attracting and seducing a man, particularly Greysteel.  Although an innocent, Velvet is a quick learner and it's not long before she's matching his barbs word for word and enchanting him even more.  Greysteel can see the softer side of Velvet and knows that her precociousness hides a gentler nature that many don't see.  Greysteel will never forget that he wasn't Velvet's first choice, but can he make her his own before it's too late?<br /><br />Fans will be interested to know that Velvet Cavendish is a descendent of the heroine of Ms. Henley's A WOMAN OF PASSION, Bess Hardwick; UNMASKED, however, stands alone very well.  The Restoration period is brought to life by the talented pen of Virginia Henley.  Many true-to-life historical characters make appearances, from Charles II himself, to Barbara Villiers, the woman who was arguably Charles's favorite mistress.  Set against the backdrop of Charles appointment to the throne, Velvet and Greysteel's romance remains the main focus in UNMASKED.  If not treated by a deft hand, they might have gotten lost in the muddle of historical facts and events that were added for a more vivid texture to this very colorful history.  Some may call Virginia Henley's writing historical fiction, but the proof that this woman still loves the romance fiction genre is between the pages in UNMASKED.<br /><br />Add UNMASKED to your fall reading list and prepare to be enthralled!<br /><br />Amy Cunningham<br /><br />Romance Reviews Todaying historical fiction, but the proof that this woman still loves the romance fiction genre is between the pages in UNMASKED. <br /> <br />Add UNMASKED to your fall reading list and prepare to be enthralled!   <br /> <br />Amy Cunningham <br />Romance Reviews Today   <br />	2005-09-08

I have been an educator and adult trainer for 30 years.  I have a full  library of activities books by Lois Hart.  When building new classes (sometimes on the same topic, but with a different purpose) I continue to count on her manuals of activities as my most valuable reference materials.  I highly recommend the Leadership Training Activity Book  to trainers and educators who are responsible for curriculum development <br /> <br />According to all accelerated learning theory, adults learn best when actively involved in the topic.  Therefore learning activities are very important when providing people experiential learning.  Learning activities built around the subject matter helps them \"get it\" so that  the concept \"sticks\" in their minds.   I have been delighted with the materials I found in her books on developingl eaders and many others written by this author, Lois B. Hart. <br />  <br />It is difficult to create a totally new workshop to teach concepts and principles such as Leadership, Team building, and Management skills.  I am grateful to find resources that have well thought-out learning exercises.  I have been very happy to apply ideas and training techniques to help explain concepts from Hart's books.   <br /> <br />As I've found with all her books, this newest book not only saves time developing the course, but provided fun, entertaining and interesting ways to make a point, explain how a method works, or give a true-to-life example.  My supervisor, manager, and leader audiences have given very complimentary evaluations on classes I have developed around her activities.      <br />  <br />I also recommend you buy her 50 Activities to Develop Leaders Vol I. Faultless Facilitation, Training Methods That Work, and Learning from Conflict.  These save me many hours of preparation time because they have easy to follow instructions.  The directions explain the objectives, provide a list of supplies required and tell me how much time the activity will take. <br/> <br />Furthermore, these books have provided inspiration.  Sometimes I have adapted the ideas in the books and altered them.  I have used them when training all types of groups with a variety of different levels of experience and knowledge. You won't be disappointed. <br />  <br />It is comforting to know that programs presented in these reference manuals are based on research and created by a knowledgeable professional who is an expert in the topic.   The activities have been tested and carefully constructed so that even an inexperienced trainer can follow the directions to a successful guided activity.	2005-09-08

These ex-spouses work together in solving crimes--mostly gory, brutal, unspeakable crimes. The latest is a young girl found buried, presumably, alive. There's a pipe protruding from her burial place which should have provided air, but an autopsy reveals that the young girl who happens to be a member of a religious cult did not suffocate but was killed by cyanide, which was poured down the breathing tube. <br /> <br />Further investigation reveals that the cult welcomes ex-cons who apparently haven't been rehabilitated. This book is not for the weak of heart. There are very graphic descriptions of murder victims. There is a subplot on domestic violence which is very revealing and it may be difficult for the reader to comprehend how a seemingly rational woman would allow herself to be continually victimized.  <br /> <br />The relationship between the Sara and Jeffrey remains unresolved, leaving room for at least a couple more books revolving around the strained relationship between this couple. <br /> <br />I enjoy Slaughter's writing style and her willingness to take the reader out of his/her comfort zone while she delivers blow after blow of gut wrenching horrors that humans--in this case--in the name of God--do unto each other.	2005-09-08

But Tori's carefree life changes forever when the Serendipity goes down during a storm in the South Pacific, taking her father to his watery grave. Tori, her gravely injured mother, and Cammy are the only ones to survive, washing ashore on a deserted island. When it becomes clear her mother will not survive, she makes Tori promise never to give up hope that her grandfather will send someone to find her. But eight years pass in their paradise prison, and the few times sailors have come upon their island, rescue was not their goal. Now wary of men, Tori is determined to elude the latest batch who've arrived on their shores.<br /><br />Like everyone else in England, Grant Sutherland and his crew are well acquainted with the tragic story of the Earl of Belmont's family. Although his son, daughter-in-law, and only grandchild were presumed lost at sea nearly a decade ago, the elderly earl refuses to believe they are dead and has beggared himself sending out countless search parties. Commissioned by the ailing nobleman to do one last search, in exchange for the earl's estate after he dies, Grant has almost given up when he sees a beautiful young woman running on the beach of an isolated island. Convinced he has found the missing Dearbournes, Grant quickly mobilizes a team to go ashore and retrieve the survivors.<br /><br />Instead of being greeted by grateful castaways wanting to leave, Grant and his men find themselves outmaneuvered time and time again by their quarry. For Grant, frustration gives way to respect, along with a growing attraction for this impetuous island woman. The feeling is mutual for Tori, and gradually she comes to believe that rescue finally has come. It is on the voyage back to England that the awareness between captain and passenger finally explodes into passion. But while Tori unabashedly revels in their intimacy, Grant finds himself torn between logic and desire. Having seen how love had nearly destroyed one brother and killed another, Grant has sworn never to care too deeply for a woman. With Tori, however, it is all or nothing.<br /><br />THE PRICE OF PLEASURE is only Kresley Cole's second book, but it cements her position as a rising star of historical romance. While the lush islands of the South Pacific come to life in her narrative, it is her complex characterization of the lead characters that capture the reader's attention.

I love to study Marilyn's image, movies, and photographs, and Addis does give alot of insight into the Monroe creation: revealing, for instance, that it took hairdresses and costumers up to six hours to get the real Marilyn ready for public appearances.  The book offers a good amount of information.  Marilyn Monroe's look, to the credit of the late actress herself and those who impersonate her, is not easy to pull off.  Makeup application steps, hairstyle and wig techniques, costume guidelines, and mannerism styles are all included.    For those who simply admire Marilyn and the glamour of her era, there are tips on how to \"Marilynize\" your image such as minimizing stage makeup techniques for everyday, and including tapered skirts and heels into your work wardrobe.    The book is cute, classy, fun, and informative.  It's not intended to be a biographical guide to Marilyn Monroe, but it is a tribute to how the indelible effects of her image can either be fun to replicate or actually become a full-time profession for those with the committment to impersonate her.	2005-09-08

I was really looking forward to reading this novel since the reviews were all excellent--please turn back now if you are even thinking of locating this book! The other reviewers are presenting an alternative reality--or I received a published, yet unedited, first draft. <br /> <br />The authors brag about writing this without an outline, without actually meeting. Well, I have no trouble believing this claim. <br /> <br />The characters (and there are so many) are wooden, despite the extremely overdone development for each of them. So much useless background information is thrown in for each of the characters (nothing some good slash and burn editing wouldn't fix), the reader is left trying to decide what he needs to retain for later. In most cases it really doesn't matter--it never reaches relevancy.  <br /> <br />The plot jumps to and fro, without really tying in to the main plot enough for the reader to figure out what is going on and why. When the reader finally figures out where the book is going, he is most likely not going to care anymore. <br /> <br />The mystery was poorly woven--again, someone needed to do some editing. And I wish the authors had had the courage to give us a villain from the characters they painstakingly developed throughout the book. This type of reward to the reader might have led me to give it 2 stars.   <br /> <br />Romance? No, sorry. We read a lot of passages about love, how important love is, but we never FEEL love from our wooden characters. I suppose the many poems are supposed to clue us in on the depth of love, instead of dialogue between our characters. Was there a sex scene? Not of the hot, steamy variety. More like \"came here, did that, ho-hum.\"   <br /> <br />This book has too many directions, too many disjointed themes. I don't remember being this disappointed in a book for a very long time. I had just finished reading an extremely well written book (The Secret Life of Bees) and early on had to counsel myself not to make comparisons on the writing, to give this one a proper chance to develop. <br /> <br />Let my words be a warning to anyone out there who thinks this might be a good read--just don't!	2005-09-08

The author was able to take a portion of John Dee's diaries and not only modernize the wording and name of places but also translate some of the Greek and Latin passages.  Hence it creates a down to earth but yet scholarly edition of John Dee's Diaries.  What really impressed me about this book were the references at the end of the chapters.  Not only does Fenton list numerous sources where to gather more information but also goes a bit more in detail about what is going on in the life of Dr. John Dee.  At the end of the book there is a \"biographical guide.\"  This part of the book is not only interesting but also invaluable.  It lists all the major characters that were involved in John Dee's diaries and shows when they were born, died, and gives a brief description of the person.  The only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars was the author's attitude towards Edward Kelly.  Edward Fenton often portrays Kelly as a trickster (which he may very well have been) but seems to add his opinion at the wrong times when there appears to be no real evidence suggesting his opinion.  Other than that one minor flaw I recommend this book to the student, teacher, casual reader, philosopher, & even to the mage.  It has made a great addition to my library & again I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-08

The book starts at the very dawn of astronomy and explains how the very first calendars were invented. It runs through medieval times explaining the discoveries of Galileo, Copernicus and many others, and concludes with the latest discoveries in cosmology, including the accelerating expansion of the universe and the discovery of extra-solar planets. This book covers it all, and more importantly, it covers discoveries in chronological order in many cases clearly showing how one discovery leads to the next. <br /> <br />One of things which I found most appealing about this book is the fact that it is broken into relatively short chapters. Each chapter begins with a short explanation by the author, followed by an excerpt from the original research paper in which the discovery was first announced. How great is it to read about Galileo's discoveries in Galileo's own (translated) words? <br /> <br />A word of caution: this is a 700 page book, and some of the research paper excerpts  included in it are very technical (especially some of the most modern ones). These are very hard, if not impossible, to understand. In many of the chapters I wished that the author's explanations were longer and more detailed, while the research paper excerpts were shorter.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you are an amateur astronomer, like me, you will LOVE this book. However this book is heavier than most popular science books and I would probably not recommend it for the casual reader of popular science.	2005-09-07

So I can say with real experience, this is one of the worst vampire books I have ever read, second only to RL Stein's travesty, \"Dangerous Girls\".    The main character, a \"Goth\" girl imaginatively named \"Raven\", is a walking Mary-Sue clich for gothic characters. She loves wearing black clothes and spider rings, hanging out in graveyards, dreaming of hot vampire boys, dressing up as a preppy tennis player for Halloween (no, it's true) and making fun of the \"popular\" kids, and can always come out on top in a clash of wits with the shamefully stupid and typical popular kids (who all wear Tommy Hilfiger, by the way). And for some reason, despite the fact that she claims everyone in her town \"hates\" her, she is never persecuted, and is in fact even the secret desire of *gasp* the most popular boy in school, with whom Raven willingly makes out, even though she claims to hate him!     As if the faux-angst teen melodrama wasn't enough, Schreiber throws in a half-baked, again clichd-out vampire plot worthy of the late, great \"Goosebumps\" series. A hot Goth boy moves into town who is: apparently foreign (with a slight accent, even!), lives in a huge old manor nobody has lived in for years, isn't seen during the daytime, only pops out at night (conveniently in the graveyard where Raven spends her time), and drops terrible hints all over the place about his true nature (think Dracula's \"I never drink...wine.\"). Things just spiral down from here, and inevitably end up at the evil of all high school evils, the PROM!    The characters are shallow, the plot is even less deep, and the extent of Raven and her vampire love-boys connection is this: \"I'm a hot goth boy.\" \"I'm a hot goth girl who loves hot goth boys.\" \"I call this town Dullsville.\" \"Oh, my God, I call this town Dullsville, too!\" (no, I promise, that last exchange ACTUALLY happens in the book) \"We're meant for each other!\"Ellen Schriber clearly has no idea how contemporary high schools work. If she did, she would know that Goths are no longer the minority, even in small towns (I once lived in a community of 4,000 people in the deserts of Arizona, and a good 20 of the kids at the high school were Goth). This wouldn't even work as a parody of the YA vampire genre, because even if Schreiber didn't quite make it there, you could tell that she was at least trying for a credible gothic love story, and NOT a parody. This is to vampire novels what Star Wars 3 is to the rest of the Star Wars series: a poorly-written drama that would have been better off as a comedy.    This book is obviously aimed at the pre-teen set, and will most likely be worshipped by young girls who have yet to enter high school. This brings NOTHING new to the vampire genre. If you want a genuinely GOOD YA book with a realistic and amusing look at the teen Goth and vampire culture, try SWEETBLOOD by Pete Hautman. But DON'T buy Vampire Kisses.	2005-09-07

Its biggest virtue lies in its organization. It's not a textbook, but it's definitely not a dry, dusty grammar like Joseph Wright's books (which, btw, are very useful books; they're just not the cover-to-cover type). The best thing about the book's layout is: it gets you reading Gothic right away! From the beginning, each chapter has:<br /><br />  1. a reading in Gothic (from Scripture generally, since practically all extant texts are of Wulfila's translation of the Bible);<br /><br />  2. all the vocab you need to understand it;<br /><br />  3. a manageable-sized description of some piece of grammar (say, a couple of classes of nouns here, a few more the next chapter) with exercises to help you drill yourself on them; and<br /><br />  4. some other information.<br /><br />These last sections range from an easy-to-read discussion about Indo-European to the place of Gothic within the Germanic language family, to a brief history of the Gothic tribes, to (later) discussions about phonetics and morphology that are more technical, not b/c of their writing style but simply b/c they're packed with information.  These stem from the book's expressed purpose of presenting Gothic not only as easily as possible for the learner, but in the context of comparative Germanics and comparative linguistics generally.<br /><br />If you're not into comparative linguistics, you can ignore these parts and still learn the language with relative speed. It's a very versatile book. A decent amount of effort on each chapter of this book will amaze you with how soon you can read Gothic texts. Highly recommended.	2005-09-07

Until you fact-check Viereck's claims, especially his citations. This was no genuine exploration of the origins of Nazi ideas, \"the roots of the Nazi mind\". This was a polemicist with an extremely conservative cultural, religious and political agenda, smearing with a proto-Nazi tag those aesthetic and cultural movements that he happens to dislike.<br /><br />Viereck's main target was the romantic movement of the 19th century, especially but not only Richard Wagner. Although Viereck wrote in the manner of a moralist condemning the romantics from on high, his agenda led him into certain failings of his own. His portrayal of \"Father Jahn\" and other figures bear false witness, and he commits academic sins like altering texts, inventing fictitious works, misleading quotation, and the like.<br /><br />Basically Viereck's story was that the National Socialist flame was lit by Friedrich Jahn, who supposedly influenced the early German romantics, Fichte, Herder and so on, who then passed the torch to Wagner, who synthesised their evil ideas into a fully-fledged Nazi philosophy with all pieces complete, from F&uuml;hrer-principle to Holocaust, which Hitler then picked up and applied.<br /><br />This is nonsense. First, the historical Friedrich Jahn was neither a proto-Nazi nor an especially important figure. Viereck truthfully called Jahn a German nationalist, which sounds sinister because of 20th century history, but glossed over the fact that Jahn's nationalism came at a time when the German states were occupied, ruled and plundered by foreign armies under Napoleon. To be a nationalist under those circumstances was to resist tyranny, not promote it.<br /><br />Viereck elides the fact that Jahn was an outspoken democrat who insisted that French rule should be replaced by a democratic, independent and unified Germany. I feel no defensiveness towards Jahn; though no proto-Nazi he was an antisemite with insufficient other merits to balance that fact. But misrepresentation is irritating.<br /><br />Viereck greatly exaggerates Jahn's importance. Jahn founded his Turnverein (gymnastics organisation) movement in 1811 and lost control of it with his imprisonment in 1819, and though he remained generally respected until his death in 1852, he exercised precious little influence. I've looked for references to Jahn in the work of the German romantics, and found only a satirical _attack_ on Jahn in an 1823 play by the romantic playwright Joseph von Eichendorff.<br /><br />Viereck's portrait of the early German romantics defames admirable people, brotherhood-of-man democrats and liberals like Herder. Fichte is less admirable, but is also utterly misrepresented. Even those German Romantics who did lose their liberalism in old age didn't turn to any form of radical rightwingery that could be called proto-Nazi. They reverted to conservative Catholicism and monarchism.<br /><br />Viereck's attack on Wagner illustrates his method. For example Viereck's first, 1941, edition of this book was the first text to frame Wagner by quoting the concluding words of \"Judaism in Music\" while - without alerting the reader - omitting Wagner's key words, \"for then we shall be one and indivisible\", in order to hide the fact that Wagner was calling for assimilation. This deception has been much imitated since.<br /><br />(Several of Viereck's supposed Wagner quotes are actually mosaics assembled by Viereck; Wagnerian phrases taken by Viereck from contexts often decades apart, and reassembled by him to form new arrangements and new meanings. Using that method I could mke Wagner, or Viereck, say whatver I felt like. It is entirely unaceptable.)<br /><br />Viereck claimed that Wagner's call for the founding of a people's army, in his \"The Revolution\" essay, was \"a dream akin to what R&ouml;hm in 1934 envisaged for his Storm Troopers.\" But Wagner's text called for the army to be under the control of a democratically elected government. Did Viereck really not know the difference between Storm Troopers in a Nazi state, and an army accountable to an elected government?<br /><br />Viereck also claimed that Wagner invented the F&uuml;hrer-principle. You'll find no such idea in Wagner, since Wagner was a young anarchist who eventually drifted as far right as supporting constitutional monarchy. So Viereck claimed that when Wagner used \"a number of other terms, especially 'hero', 'folk-king' and 'Barbarossa'\", he really meant \"F&uuml;hrer\". Viereck pioneered the technique of claiming that if Wagner's words don't support your conspiracy theory, then the words must be in a secret code. Thus anything can be said to mean any old thing, making \"proving\" a case much easier.<br /><br />Viereck also invented a Wagner essay called \"Heroism\", which apparently called for racial purity under a dictatorship. There is no such Wagner essay, nor any Wagner essay that ever called for either racial purity or dictatorship. Wagner's clearest late statement on political systems, \"State and Religion\", advocated constitutional monarchy, the monarch exercising a symbolic function above politics, while political parties of \"men of equal rights\" contended for office.<br /><br />Wagner did write, in an essay called \"Heroism and Christianity\", that there was no such thing as a German race and that Europeans should get used to racial intermingling, explicitly advocating racial equality \"under a universal moral concord, such as only Christianity can bring about.\"<br /><br />Is \"Heroism and Christianity\" related to Viereck's fictitious \"Heroism\" essay? Hard to say. Still, Viereck, who writes from a rightwing Christian worldview, needed to insist that the late Wagner was anti-Christian, though the essays and _Diaries_ show this is quite untrue. This can have comic results, as when Viereck used an anti-Christian remark by the young Wagner to prove that _Parsifal_, written decades later, must be anti-Christian. It may be that Viereck, with his own agenda, was embarrassed by the words \"and Christianity\" from Wagner's \"Heroism and Christianity\" title, so he \"disappeared\" them, along with the actual content of that essay.<br /><br />Summary: This book has been tremendously influential, especially in its earliest editions.

I was lucky enough to find it on a remainder table in a Cambridge book store, and I took a chance.  It is short (240 pages) and a perfect airplane read if you like serious writing but can't get too serious while traveling.  The other reviewers have done a good job commenting on the Little Women theme, which is enjoyable, and yes, the novel stands on its own even if you haven't read the other-- beyond that, I was struck by the true to life depiction of certain kinds of east-coast families who define their own pedigrees (Janet and Lou seem self-made, their own parents were neither old-money nor nurturing), and the network of name-dropping, (names of people, places, and private schools) that these families really do employ to make sure they are consorting with their own kind.  Janet and Lou raised a family so beautiful that outsiders comment on the street, and I know some families who aspire to this same thing, but in the end, who can blame them, if they can pull it off?   <br /> <br />Then the novel takes us where we wish all the children from such families would go (at least temporarily)-- into a situation where they are not coddled and have to learn what it takes to bring home groceries, and what it means to attend school where the teachers aren't paid enough to care whether they live up to their respecitve, darling potentials.  <br /> <br />Just when I was really enjoying all the characters and anticipating spending a good, long time with them, I noticed I was halfway through the novel, and lamented it would be too short.  In fact the author explored the up-dated parallels to Little Women just long enough so it didn't become tiresome, and left some questions un-answered (After Teddy professes his love to Jo and she can't return it, will he eventually turn to Amy?) The climax of the book looks like it will revolve around a love-interest of Meg's but the author brings it around, skillfully, to where it needs to go--that is, the relationship with their parents. <br /> <br />I loved the set-up in the beginning for the line \"Are Janet and Lou getting divorced?\"--we know the kids call their liberal parents Janet and Lou, but that line threw me off-balance and set the tone for the story for me.  I recommend this book - have fun with it.	2005-09-07

Pat Brown  The Democratic Party in CA	Ethan Rarick has written a great biography of a man who was to be one of the most well known of California Governors.Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown came on the political scene as DA of San Francisco County. He would follow the path of Earl Warren as State Attorney General and then Governor. Brown in 1958 became only the second Democrat elected governor in the 20th Century; Culbert L. Olson served 1939-1943. \"Pat\" Brown picked the right time to run for governor when US Senator William F. Knowland figured to use the California governorship as a stepping stone to run for President. Popular governor Goodwin J. \"Goodie\" Knight was forced by Knowland to seek his vacated Senate seat. This broke the GOP is California. Then, Knowland endorced  Proposition 18 \"The Right To Work Law.\" This lost the labor vote for the GOP totally. Brown would win in a landslide. Four years later, the governor's race in 1962, Brown defeated former Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Nixon made the famous remark to the press: \" You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore.\"<br /><br />\"Pat\" Brown, in 1966 faced in a run for a 3rd term, a washed up actor from Warner Brothers, in the 1950's the host of General Electric Theatre and now the host of television's Death Valley Days.

She gives Muslims one of three unwritten categories; 1)the few that agree with her, 2)those that commit the unfairness of \"desert Islam\"(who are over-represented), and 3)those that are \"silent\" about the people that do(a charge that is inconvenient, as it places the greater burden of proof on the accused, not the accuser). <br /> <br />Secondly, she seems biased towards the West and Israel.  <br />Islamic abuses are seen as the norm, while Israeli and Western abuses are mentioned, then de-emphasized or presented as exceptions. One good example is when she believes that her attempts to enter the mosque were evidence of unfair treatment, while the Palestinian getting health care was not. <br /> <br />Thirdly, Manji twists Muslim arguments to her advantage, such as in making fun of Islam's \"hijacking\" metaphor and claiming that Islam never stood for civil rights, She also shifts the focus on the Laila story from love to female conditions, when the fact that Manjun does not judge Laila on her outward appearances says much about his attitude towards women. Additionally, she rejects the charge that she is unloving towards the vast majority of Muslims, and uses the (admittedly poor) wording of the critic to make another attack on Islam.  <br /> <br />Finally, Manji seems almost willing to believe that it is always Islam that is the problem, and that it is always Islam that needs to reform, which manifests itself in the previous examples, as well as the fact that she ignores people such as Asma Barlas, who are able to find feminist teachings in the Qur'an, and who see it as a book that inspires good in Muslims. <br /> <br />Manji's book, however, does have some good features. Actions such as the ones she describe do take placae in the Middle East, even if the practitioners are only following their interpretation of Islam. This book is useful for those who might be inclined to disagree with it(such as myself), as a way of seeing what the other side has to say, and examining one's own beliefs. Additionally, she has a good sense of humor, and is able to present her experiences in an interesting and readable way. Finally, she writes what she does out of concern about Islam, not hatred towards it. However, her concern is not only misplaced, but her cirticisms are often unfair, and her work suffers as a result.	2005-09-06

Dark Lover is a feast of sensuality and a breath of fresh air for those who love paranormal romances, vampires in particular. Ward does a splendid and thorough job of creating a world where vampires exist as a separate species, not hunting and tormenting humans, but simply trying to live as they must in a soceity that not only does not accept them, but persecutes them as well. Wrath is sympathetic and HOT as the leader of the brotherhood, and Beth is fascinating as the half-breed he falls in love with. The strength and determination she demonstrates make her a worthy companion for Wrath. I don't think I can adequately state how much I loved and enjoyed this book. I was awed by the creativity that it took for Ward to build an entire race of people, touched by the relationship between the hero and heroine, and pleased that even though their was so 'much' story in the book, that above all, the romance between Wrath and Beth rose to the top and reached out and grabbed me by the throat... and the heart.

I bought this book on impulse in a book store, after being swayed by the many glowing reviews.  I was extremely disappointed in it. <br /> <br />As advertised, \"Scarecrow\" does deliver thrill-a-minute, over-the-top, non-stop action. In fact, it just reeks of the author hoping someone will buy up the movie rights. <br /> <br />However, the non-stop action is also painfully nonsensical.  I've enjoyed many thrillers, and understand that there is some suspension of disbelief required for the genre.  However, this book goes much further, requiring the complete suspension of higher brain functions.  I'm afraid that even James Bond or Dirk Pitt would be rolling their eyes and muttering \"Yeah, sure, THAT could happen!\" <br /> <br />The worst aspect was the writing.  Honestly, I was alternating between shaking my head in disbelief, and laughing out loud at how unintentionally bad it was.  The half-hearted attempts to assemble words into sentences were really that pathetic.  Often the descriptive vocabulary made me wonder if it had been cobbled together using the thesaurus of the author's word processor. <br /> <br />I can only conclude that the fans who made this a best seller and wrote all of the 5-star reviews are young boys taking a short break from their video gaming addiction.

These can be useful repositories of facts, helpful opinion and good advice. However, they often have the texture, in my opinion, of sand. The authors' ideas are a little too clear and distinct.<br /><br />Then there are those books written by authors who have invested a career, or a life-times habit of critical thinking, in their work. There is a subtly, an echo of wisdom, in the distinctions made. These have the texture of fine clay. This is one such book.<br /><br />And Bill Walsh is a gifted writer. \"Lapsing into a Comma\" is a delight to read.<br /><br />If you are serious about your copy-editing, then you should not pass this one over.	2005-09-06

With the reappearance of Madeline's old flame, now a Jesuit brother, they have the ultimate plum assignment:  catering breakfast for the Pope and 2000 of LA's movers and shakers.  A mysterious note found tucked into an old cookbook, the inexplicable murders of first one and then another seemingly unconnected members of the clergy, and threats of bodily harm all distract Madeline from the business at hand, however.  The deeper she delves into these troubling events, the more sinister the secrets become.   <br /> <br />Once again, this second installment in the series is outstanding.  The writing is brisk and sharp, and laced with humor.  The characters are well-developed and quirky.  The heroine is bright, determined, spunky and funny, and the added information about her history is interesting and well-handled by the author.  There is a good sense of place; perhaps the geography is a bit less developed than in the first book, but the culture of Hollywood is almost another character here.   <br /> <br />So why only 4 stars?  There is one major, blatant clue in the first murder that Madeline overlooks, and even later when it occurs to her she neglects to give it the consideration and attention it obviously merits.  The progression through Maddy's investigation to the ultimate solution is just slightly and vaguely less satisfying than in the previous book.  Ultimately, the balance here has tipped from the mystery to the personalities involved.  Nevertheless, it is overall an engaging book, well written and well worth reading.	2005-09-06

In this grim age of al-Qaeda, al-Zarqawi, Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War, Mr. Peters' new book undeniably tells us to remain positive. <br />   The twenty essays contained within this great book speak of moderation and common sense in our strategic approach to the world we share with billions of others. True, critics will say he argues for the killing of this Islamic extremist or that, but honestly: this is a War on Terror we're fighting, and do such irredeemable souls like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Osama bin Laden really need to walk this Earth?  <br />    Mr. Peters just brings common sense to our current problems. An example: Iraq. To paraphrase him, \"In warfighting, if you're not going to fight to win then don't fight at all. Anything short of victory (e.g., the physical destruction of al-Qeada)is defeat.\" Most Americans know this; one wishes our politicians would read this book and then display more testicular fortitude in their conducting our two Middle Eastern incursions. <br />   The overall message in New Glory is to remain positive as we look to the future. America can still cultivate many powerful alliances in this new century, but we must do so with common sense, moderation, respect for our partners instead of this high-nosed arrogance we've displayed lately and the American benevolence that has made our country a great and shining beacon of freedom in this world. We have to get back to being the good Americans that the overwhelming coreof this country already is, and our leaders must stop creating this image of Americans as intrusive and meddling greed-driven political hacks (aka Rumsfeld, Bremer, etc, etc). <br />    This review probably has been a little too vague, but...MAN!

I had read Joel Fuhrman's \"Eat to Live\" (read my review) and bought into the idea quite fully. Nevertheless the 10% solution added much to my knowledge on the subject. In particular, I found Kurzweil's clarifications about healthy and unhealthy fats particularly insightful and some of my faulty beliefs about polyunsaturated fats were rectified. Canola oil may be free of cholestrol but that doesnt mean its harmless ! Olive oil is a little better but go easy on that too. <br /> <br />Kurzweil has organized this book as a question and answer conversation between himself and a skeptic. This interesting format makes for easier reading. There are also some useful charts about ideal weight based on a system that are a little more advanced than the simplistic Body Mass Index. You are probably going to find out like me that you have a few more pounds to shed than you initially thought ! <br /> <br />My only complaint about this book is that it hasnt been revised in almost a decade and so doesnt contain a lot of lessons learned from recent research. While the book does talk about caloric restriction as a life extension method, it does not stress adequately, the recent findings of the CRON (Calorie restriction with optimal nutrition) diet. While the importance of cutting down fat is explained very well, the disease fighting capabilities of fruits and vegetables and their extraordinary importance in a healthy diet are not adequately emphasised in this book.  <br /> <br />Recent research shows us that many of the cancer fighting properties of fruits and vegetables may come from compounds whose importance we dont fully understand yet. Perhaps we may never fully isolate all compounds and we almost certainly wont be able to put them all into pills. Many of the recipes in the book are focussed on cutting down fat but dont try hard enough to make the non fat calories nutritionally dense. In that respect the book doesnt go far enough. Joel Fuhrman succintly summarizes it all in his book \"Eat to Live\" when he asks the reader to go right now and paste a note on the fridge that says \"The salad is the main dish!\" <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is a great book but if you are going to read only one book, that better be \"Eat to Live\".	2005-09-06

I recall pointing out a problem because with something Loretta said.  The response was venomous that I would DARE to question Loretta's analysis(?).   <br /> <br />The problem with this book is that it is based solely on the ideas of a woman who has not been trained in the areas she claims expertice.  She objects violently when someone who has REAL experience and expertice disagrees with her.  You can't trust what she says in her writings because they are designed to support her belief in what the truth \"ought to be\" rather than what the truth really is.  I have also seen examples where someone corrected her errors and she immediately banned that person, deleted their comments, and then rewrote her entries to fit what the person had said, as though she herself had thought of it!   <br /> <br />I read enough of the entries in this book to know that this writer thrives on her ability to project her own sick ideas on others and then call them fact.  In her words, she uses her pen to bring the people who she does not like to their knees.  Truth has nothing to do with it because when you are Ms. Dillon, you do not need truth behind you.	2005-09-06

A bit of a disappointment.  Through the first 100 pages or so, I really held high hopes for this series, but my patience fizzled fast.  The author spends a lot of time weaving images which have very little story, characters that are confusing and dull, and the story is so winding, and rambling that I lost interest long ago about who these people are and what they're doing. <br /> <br />Erikson seems to be someone who likes to use intellectual, supposedly 'smart' ideas, but lacks the ability of translating those ideas into a form that your average reader can understand.   <br /> <br />George R.

At this time Xenakis was working as assistant to Le Corbusier on The Convent of La Tourette (1953-1960),and from this Xenakis had developed a concept of space through the design of the side chapel of this site created in darkness. With \"gentle light cannons\" however Xenakis was able to redefine the space and configurations; light was then allowed to \"cut\", \"incises\" from this undefined darknesses. So the space is no longer defined simply by the volume structured by walls; what you perceive as space,as depth,as volume becomes more fluid,and glib. Light volume was a controlling function here.<br />Also exhibited another performance art work was at the Shiraz Festival in Iran in 1971, when the Shah was Washington's proxy, this at the ruins of Persepolis. Xenakis had designed another installation a counterpoint of light,bonfire,(in a distance)as well as timbre, space and volume, also densities, texture of light timbre mixed.. Some 59 loudspeakers,an 8 channel tape of primarily \"musique concrete\" sounds, 92 spotlights, 2 lasers directed at the sky in a configuration. The light program here is also updated every 1/25th of a second so to keep again the fluidity of the work in some kind of motion.(Actually beaming lasers acros great dimensions of the Earth in some mathematical configuration(s) is a way, a means of contacting extraterrestial beings, should they be watching)<br />Finally,for the opening of the Pompidou Centre in Paris in 1978 Xenakis created \"Le Diatope\" featuring here strobe lights, colored lasers, green and blue and red,with mirros to reflect the light in various symmetrical configurations.This book hansomely illustrates much of this including onion skin paper as overlays for the effects of the conceptions here,density distributions are also charted in acoustical graphs, top to bottom of frequencies utilized. You also find here sketches done Xenakis for every feature of this work, light,sound,space.I cannot help think how this work had influenced the music Xenakis then wrote,how the experience of space, working in different places, and experiencing how light comes to occupy,embellish,taut and punctuate a space had impinged on his more self-contained compact music he had written.But in circumvention to this Xenakis had designed much of his \"polytopes\" from scores he had written in varying degree of \"voices\" imparted throughout a space on the musical partitura page. Again the fluidity of space had influenced the fluidity of the conceptual working procedures.in various symmetrical configurations.This book hansomely illustrates much of this including onion skin paper as overlays for the effects of the conceptions here,density distributions are also charted in acoustical graphs, top to bottom of frequencies utilized.

It is not hard at all.  This is a good story because the mom has had a hard life, and so does her son.  James the mother's son has a hard time during his teenage years.  This biography is very interesting. <br />When James was fourteen, he had trouble with drugs and school.  He moved with his sister foe a while and still had trouble.  More things happened, but you should read the book to find out what happens during this time. <br /> This biography is full of surprises and will always have you guessing and wanting for more. <br /> The reason that I choose this story was because it looked interesting and what the reviews said about the biography. After reading the first two chapters, I could not stop reading.  It was good and it surprised me in many ways.  The book surprised me in an emotional way that I did not think I would have toward the characters.  <br /> The reason you should read this book is that you will be amazed of how you feel when you finish reading this book.  This is for both a girl and a boy.  The reason is that the story is divided in half from a boy experience and a girl experience later turning into an adult's experience.  <br /> The book is juxtaposed in a good manner that you can compare both lives of the son and the mother.  I think the difference between the stories is the race and gender.  Everything else is the same.  Therefore, if you think you have a hard live or think you had a hard live, read this book and compare both lives to yours. <br /> <br />	2005-09-06

It addresses the issues of behavior problems, e.g. meltdowns, routines, sleep and toileting issues and outlines behaviors that are often exhibited by children with autism.<br /><br />Neurotypical (NT) and people on the autism/Asperger's (a/A) spectrum alike will get a lot out of this book.  The clear, direct style of writing will certainly be appreciated by all readers.  It's just a good old common sense guide.<br /><br />To make a good thing even better, this booklet includes a list of helpful resources.  Soothing activities to ward off or help a child coming off of overload are given, such as a deep pressure massage and some soothing tapes.  George Harrison is ideal for musical relaxation.<br /><br />This book makes me think of the 1967 Beatle classic, \"Getting Better All the Time.\"  To this author's credit, no promises are made, but helpful approaches are suggested.	2005-09-06

Some are hilarious, as you'd expect. But most are tales of frustration, anger, and sorrow, with the occasional triumph when the good guy wins and the bad guy gets put away 'til he's gray. To hear them tell it that doesn't happen enough, but they keep going until they burn out, transfer off the street, or quit altogether. Too often they die in the line of duty, and when that happens, their fellow officers sincerely mourn the loss. <br /> <br />It surprised me to discover how compassionate these men and women are...not only toward the victims they comfort, but criminals they arrest and help convict. What Cops Know will give you a true picture of what cops think, too.	2005-09-06

It looked Interesting enough, so I bought it.It is only 247 pages long but I still loved it. Elexa Daily is very easy to relate to, in my opinion. My favorite character, besides Alexa, is the wolf Darius. The book has a very nice ending, not sad at all. The ten-year-old i babysit for absolutely loved it.<br /><br />ABOUT THE BOOK: It's about Twelve-year-old Alexa Daily, an adventure loving girl, and how she is the only person who can help the animals outside the protective barrier surrounding the entire town Alexa lives in. During Her adventure, Alexa encounters an unusually small little man named Yipes, a wolf named Darius, a squirrel named Murphy, and a few others as well. Alexa eventually finds a stone that allows her to speak the same language as the animals. She must find out who Sebastian is. And all she has to go on is that he is an escaped convict posing  as a citizen of Bridewell ( Bridewell is the town Alexa and her father are in ) and that he had changed his name, to what, she doesn't know. Alexa doesnt know who she can trust anymore, and for all she knows Sabatian could be her own father.<br /><br />I hope my review has been helpful =)	2005-09-06

To tell you the truth this novel started out confusing at the beginning. I believe this happened because before I even read this novel I said to my self \"this book is going to be boring.\"  Well I was wrong maybe it began boring but that does not mean it ended boring.  What I did was judge the book by its cover and that was wrong.  Therefore, a tip for next time would be not to a judge a book by its cover. <br />  Well, as I was reading the novel more and more it became interesting because Rachel one of the characters would explain her life by details.  She would say how she never was loved as a child or as an adult and her life never was easy. Another thing she would say was that at almost all the nights her father would come in to her room and abuse her, her own father come on that's sad. The worst thing was that Rachel's mother has had a disease that all her left body was numbed.  She would always try to look good and her husband would tell her why your try so hard to look good just give it up. Her husband had never cared for her not even one bit.  <br />   <br /> Well the author and the second main character of this novel was James Mc Bride. James was the youngest child out of all twelve kids in his house, and in my opinion, the youngest kids are the one who suffer the most as a child and probably as an adult.  Well James was always picked on by his brother and his sisters.  They would always mess with him because he actually believed what they always told him. Well one of his best role models I think was his mother Rachel. She would always push her kids to do the best they could do and if they did something, wrong when they could have done something better, at home they would get a spanking by their mother.  <br /> <br />  In this novel, it talks about no matterwhat color you are or if you're poor or rich, you would always have problems in life.  Well I recommend this book to all patient people or students because the interesting part happens at the middle of the book.  If your' not patient well good luck if you want to read this book. <br /> <br /> <br />        Sincerely, <br />              Marelisa Castillo <br />	2005-09-06

This book is not for young teens!  The words \"hermaphrodite\" and \"castration\" appear in the first pages.  There are graphic, hardcore sexual references made repeatedly throughout the story including a representation of a man leaving his marital bed, sprouting a second set of genitalia and copulating with a widow and her daughter at the same time. This book is a dark, warped social commentary on politics and ignorance, it is not a happy elaboration on the fantasy world of Baum.  I have read other books by Gregory Maguire and enjoyed them, but this book is a shocker - and not in a good way.  The musical Wicked recommends that the play is not for children under 8.  The book should not be recommended to anyone under 17.  This is rough stuff.	2005-09-06

Using real-life facts and figures he weaves an exciting tale of a father who loses his son to a child molester and goes on a one-man crusade against pedophilia.  Throughout the book he wrestles with his conscience over the age-old question of whether the end can ever really justify the means.  Like Kurtz in Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" he is plagued by the \"horror\" of his mission.  But it is much more than a book about vigilantism.  It is an enthralling action/adventure novel full of embracing and insightful information and philosophy.  Mills has the courage to explore the heinous and much ignored world of pedophilia and shows us that it is a much more pervasive social problem than most people realize.  If you want to be educated and entertained at the same time, To Protect The Innocent is the book for you.  But be aware, it is hard to put down and will undoubtedly keep you up nights.  <br />	2005-09-06

The imaginative poetic style of this outstanding first novel evokes the opulence of Garcia Marquez while weaving a rare tapestry of human tenderness, fragility and flaw. Falconer's eloquent tale of obsession, beauty and madness is a tribute to the beauty of metaphor and entices the reader to savour to the author's own passion for images. Her novel approaches a certain reign of the imagination and the age-old literary quest to portray essentially incommunicable emotions. The Service Of Clouds evokes magnificently the mystical beauty of the Blue Mountains and charts the obsessivve tenacity of a women who grasps for love and is ultimately smothered by it. A magnificent novel of haunting and persistent beauty.	2005-09-06

As does the TV series, this book tells the story of a parade of food products.  Unlike the TV show, this book focuses exclusively on specific products invented by American food industry -- inventions such as SPAM, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Hawaiian Punch and Kellogg's Pop-Tarts. <br /> <br />In general, I'm not a big fan of pre-packaged food. Having said that, I've probably eaten just about everything Ms. Wyman chronicles at least once. And so it was fun learning the origins of foods like Tater Tots (designed to use the leftover potatoes from making Ore-Ida French Fries) and Redd-Wip whipped cream (which had to overcome the 1940s association of aerosol spray cans and insecticide). <br /> <br />The author seems vacillates between a genuine admiration and a healthy (pun intended) disdain for her subject.  On the one hand, she says of Kraft's mac-and-cheese: \"It's cheap, keeps nearly a year without refrigeration, and is quick and easy to make while still demanding enough to make you feel like you're cooking.\"  On the other hand, she opens her chapter about Wonder Bread this way: \"Bread is called the staff of life. What does it say about America that its best-selling bread is as soft as a pillow, as absorbent as a sponge, and as gaily dressed as a clown?\" <br /> <br />The book is attractively laid out and filled with graphics including some of the original packaging and ads for the foods (see, for example, a young Frank Gifford reaching for a glass of Minute Maid Orange Juice from concentrate). <br /> <br />So if you can get past the schizophrenic editorial voice, it's a fun romp through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the American food industry.	2005-09-05

She told me that this book demonstrated \"evolution in action.\" This excited me, so I read this book hoping to find some convincing evidence for evolution.<br /><br />Jonathan Weiner did a remarkable job of recording the Grant's work into an extremely readable book, and I hope that what I'm about to say doesn't detract from the dedicated fieldwork of the Grants, whose incredibly detailed measurements of thousands of birds over a 20-year period on the small island of Daphne Major are a major contribution to the study of population dynamics and ecology.<br /><br />It is very unfortunate that neither Weiner or the Grants couldn't understand the simple act that, while natural selection is a necessary aspect of the evolution model, demonstrating it does not in and of itself demonstrate evolution(if by evolution you mean single cell creatures becoming today's biosphere). What I mean is that natural selection does not produce NEW GENETIC INFORMATION. For bacteria-to-man evolution to work, there MUST be an increase in new genetic information. Neither Weiner nor the Grants demonstrated one example of an increase in new genetic information. Rather, they demonstrated many examples of a LOSS of information, which is what natural selection does.<br /><br />Another unfortunate aspect of this book were the serious misrepresentations of creationists. Both the Grants and Weiner seemed to think that any inheritable change in a population is a deathblow to creationists. Nothing could be further from the truth. Creationists have no problem with the concept of \"change through time.\" What we have a problem with is \"change with the increase of NEW GENETIC INFORMATION.\" Throughout the book, Wiener creates these straw men, and many more. I could go on all day on how Wiener seriously misrepresented creationists, but I would rather end this review on a good note.<br /><br />To the creationist, this book greatly confirms the biblical account of creation, that God created plants and animals according to their kind(not species), and that there are genetic limits to these kinds. For me, natural selection is powerful evidence for an intelligent designer, that God programmed each kind of animal with the genetic information to adapt to many different environments.<br /> <br />To the creationist, this book greatly confirms the biblical account of creation, that God created plants and animals according to their kind(not species), and that there are genetic limits to these kinds.

In the course of settling in,he meets a homeless man, an embittered Vietnam veteran with a history of his own, who is initially quite isolated from the rest of humanity by choice.

Researching family roots sometimes brings surprising results.  As the author describes in her forward, she wasn't planning on writing a book when she quit her corporate job to do nothing but genealogical research.  But as the details of her family's slave background slowly emerged, she combined factual information with family lore to create this saga of her mixed black and white heritage.  \"Cane River\" starts out like any novel with one difference.  All of a sudden we see a copy of a letter, a legal document, a newspaper clipping or a photograph.  Something clicks then - and transports the reader into the reality of the institution of slavery - a shameful dark legacy that is part our American history.<br /><br />The book is 522 pages long, but I read in a few days, in the heat and humidity of a New York City summer, finding time after work to read on a park bench Washington Square Park as twilight fell around me. That's when I opened the book and let myself be transported to Louisiana, at a time when everyone spoke French and the white families ruled the land and there was no way that slaves could ever rise above the institution that held them captive.  The book begins with two 9-year old girls.  One is white.  One is black. The black girl is the white girl's slave.  The slave might be able to go to church with the white girl and even take first communion.  But she will never learn to read.  And she will always have to serve the white masters.  Yes, it's true she is a \"house\" slave.  She will never spend her life bending down in the field.  But she will spend her life standing up.  Because, with the exception of a few kitchen chores, if a house slave has a few moments when she is not actively working, she is standing and waiting to be told what to do next.<br /><br />Through the character of Suzette, who was a real person in the author's family history, we meet this girl child who will never learn to read, as she is raped as by a white man and bears his child.  And later, bears a second child from him.  We meet her mother Elizabeth who had been sold away from two young sons in her former home.  We meet her deaf mute sister who works in the fields like a man has her three young children sold away from her.  We meet the white slaveholder who treats his slaves like children with a bit of benevolence.  But when he dies, his widow is helpless in running the plantation and the cruel overseer takes over.  Sooner or later all the slaves get sold off.  The author just doesn't simply tell us about it though.  She makes us feel it.  She has the slaves first come to be listed as inventory.  They have to line up by age, separated from their families.  They are all panicked.  Their families are all that they have.  Suzette begs the white father of her children to buy the children.<br /><br />But this is just the first generation.  Suzette's daughter Philomene has a story of her own.  She's lucky because she knows real love for a short time with another slave and bears twin girls.  Then he is sold away.  There's a white man interested in her though.  He takes care of her somewhat for awhile and she bears him eight children  Their oldest, Emily, is taught to read and write.  And even has her portrait painted in New Orleans.  A photo of that portrait shows a young girl with light skin who looks as if she leads a privileged life.  That is not the case though.<br /><br />We follow these people through the Civil War and through emancipation.  There are moments of joy and family bonding.  And, through the years, their situation does improve a bit.  But even if there is no more slavery, there is still angry racism which often results in murder.  And even though Emily's French lover and father of her five children wants to protect her, he still cannot give her any land, and finds his own life in danger from his fellow white men.<br /><br />Through it all, though, there is the family, held together by the women, who live through all the horror and somehow stay strong.  The book ends in 1936, with a glimpse of the racism which had replaced the institution of slavery.  There were tears in my eyes then, mostly for the sorrowful lives so many people had been forced to live.  But those tears were also of admiration for the endurance of this family who actually lived though it all.

I guess that's what to expect when a reporter and an anonymous hotelier with years of experience band together to bring you this story of one man's 24 hours inside a hotel. The narrator is a hotel employee who finds himself pulling double shifts. We get a glimpse not only of the wacky and sometimes badly behaved guests, but also of the hotel staff's struggles to please them. Some of the chapters did freak me out a bit, considering I read this right before I went away to a large hotel, but nothing TOO shocking here.	2005-09-05

If you were anything like myself, and were intrigued by the famous  Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory; you would be interested in giving this book a chance. It is fiction so you can't read it as if it were a biography, but it does carry some historical truth to it. The story jumps from Elizabeth Bathory's life in the 16th century to the 20th century following one of her ancestors life. One who shares more with her then he ever wanted to. <BR> The story is very vivid in describing graphic scenes of sex and gore. Some parts were shocking even to someone not easily bothered by such themes. At parts you wonder how much liberty the writer took in describing her life and yet as you read on you become enraptured in the book and stop questioning what's realistic and what's not. Elizabeth Bathroy is such a baffling yet intruiging character in history that it's hard not to find this book appealing.	2005-09-05

This book is just *oozing* with hatred of Jews.   <br /> <br />Norman Finkelstein seems to think that by accusing Jews of being overly-sensitive, and because he's a Jew himself, he's immune from any criticism on that front.  (He once bragged in an interview that he \"can get away with things which nobody else can.\")   <br /> <br />But can anyone doubt that Finkelstein isn't quite fond of Jews after reading Part I of his book, which is nothing more than a long rant about what lousy, hateful people American Jews are? <br /> <br />Nor is anything that Finkelstein writes credible.  Let me give you just one example (and I could list examples like this all day). Finkelstein writes, \"It is hard to make out any difference between the policy Dershowitz advocates and the Nazi destruction of Lidice, for which he expresses abhorrence-except that Jews, not Germans, would be implementing it.\" (p. 176).  I've been reading Dershowitz for a long time, and comparing his mild proposals for dealing with terrorism with the Lidice massacre of 1942 is just batty.   <br /> <br />Here's what Dershowitz actually wrote in the passage Finkelstein cites: \"[Israel] would then publicly declare precisely how it will respond in the event of another terrorist act, such as by destroying empty houses in a particular village that has been used as a base for terrorists, and naming that village in advance.\" <br /> <br />Um ... \"destroying empty houses\" doesn't exactly sound like genocide to me.  Then again, I don't get the same kick Finkelstein seems to enjoy every time he compares Jews to Nazis.  (Question: How come Finkelstein never compares Jews to other repressive nations or movements like, say, the Soviets under Stalin or the Khmer Rouge?  Answer: Because he wants to be as hurtful to Jews as possible.)    <br /> <br />Finkelstein is relying on the fact that we won't check the original sources.  He's banking on the ignorance of his audience.  Every paragraph is a fresh insult to his readership's intelligence.   <br /> <br />Professor Peter Novick got it exactly right: \"As concerns particular assertions made by Finkelstein . . . the appropriate response is not (exhilarating) `debate' but (tedious) examination of his footnotes. Such an examination reveals that many of those assertions are pure invention.... No facts alleged by Finkelstein should be assumed to be really facts, no quotation in his book should be assumed to be accurate, without taking the time to carefully compare his claims with the sources he cites.\"	2005-09-05

If anyone is expecting to be spoon fed the required information on any 3D program they should consider a new occupation. <br /> <br />3D modelling and animation is, by its very nature, all about problem solving as no two projects are alike. However, for those willing to invest some time and effort to STUDY the book's concepts and content then a reward can be found. The previous reviewers were correct in that often a complete set of instructions were left out.

Mahoney has published studies of Charles de Gaulle, Raymond Aron, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn.  In his new book on Bertrand de Jouvenel, Mahoney continues his ever-widening exploration of the the religio-political question in modernity.<br /><br />Any of Mahoney's readers should recognize his characteristic strengths, once again in evidence here: the balanced critical judgment, the wide and deep learning, the spirited wit.  What seems to have gone unremarked so far, however, is the overall outline of his project.  With Aron, the secularized Jew, Solzhenitsyn the Russian Orthodox believer, de Gaulle--who perhaps was thinking of himself when he spoke to Malraux of men \"whose Christian faith was dim but who were, nonetheless, not Voltaireans\"--and now de Jouvenel, the firm and judicious Roman Catholic, Mahoney is exploring the ways that thoughtful men who were formed and in some cases animated by religious conviction found their bearings when the supreme ambitions of modernity issued in world war, tyranny, and genocide.<br /><br />In this book as in the others, Mahoney shows himself unmatched in his ability to introduce a thinker to new readers while illuminating him to old ones.  Having suffered neglect for thirty years or more, de Jouvenel reappears as a worthy successor to Tocqueville--one situated, moreover, in a modernity whose grimness even Tocqueville had underestimated, and so forced to confront things Tocqueville could scarcely imagine.<br /><br />The book itself is compact, well designed, fairly priced--a companiable volume, as befits the humane and judicious spirit one finds inside it.	2005-09-05

Don't let this theory get out of hand. Most of this book is a lot of statistics and data. The real truth is--yes you have to look good. Use your best qualities and stay looking presentable. Secondly, you do have to be approachable. Guys get intimidated easily when they meet a confident woman. Like it or not that is true.<br /><br />However, did anyone notice that these interviews took place when people were in the marriage licensing bureau. How many unhappy people to you see there?  Get real.  If John Molloy wants to prove his theory true, then he should re-interview these same couples in a few years to see how many of them are still together.  Then you'll know if this info is really true or not. The divorce rate isn't 50% for nothing. Remember that.<br /><br />I'll tell you what, no one tells you what to do when he loses  interest in you. No one prepares for when your life changes because he loses  his job, dies or ends up disabled permanently. No one tells you to discuss finances on a regular basis to make sure the two of you are on the same page because if you are not, you'll be apart in no time. I see more miserable married women due to financial problems. Everyone wants the ring, big house, picket fence and a jeep with no real money to pay for it. Ring any bells?<br /><br />How's this for advice. Women get a realistic education and have your own money all the time. You might have to start over on your own when you least expect it. Get a background check done on him before you marry him. What you don't know can kill you (remember Laci Peterson).<br /><br />The point in the book about women who were concentrating on furthering careers instead of dating more was nonsense. I used to work with doctors and all of them had educated accomplished wives who weren't that great looking. I don't know a successful married man who has a file clerk for a wife. Even if she is drop dead gorgeous they still want a woman with their own life/interests.  I'm going back to school in the spring and I'll never regret my education and skills no matter how lonely I am. Remember we can always get laid off or fired without warning. I need to know whether I'm married or single I can take care of myself. Just because you have a husband does not mean that he can take care of you or even that he wants to. There might come a time when the wife will have the only income available. What'll you do then?  File clerk money can't pay all the bills. Neither can a part time job. Hello? You have to be able to be a partner. Have each other's back so to speak. Fill in the blanks when your husband can't.<br /><br />Last point. Marriage is not for everybody. Too many people figure that out too late in the game and are looking for a way out.  I've seen a lot of that. I just don't think men want to be with the same woman for a long period of time. It's like they are always looking for a better deal somewhere else.  I could be wrong.

The first two are \"A London Child of the 1870's\", and \"A London Girl of the 1880's\".  Both are highly recommended, and I strongly suggest that you read both before you read this. <br /> <br />In this third volume, the quality is at times not quite as high as in the first two.  There are exceptions -- a tragic episode is described unsentimentally at one point, and brought me close to tears -- but the book is very anecdotal.  It covers the time from her engagement, as Mary Thomas, to Arthur Hughes, in the late 1880's, to their marriage in July 1897, and a few years past that into early marriagehood.  During that time, while still single, she visits the World's Fair in Chicago to attend an educational conference, and manages to visit Washington and Boston as well. <br /> <br />There are stories about her prospective in-laws; her brothers and their families; her fianc; and her work as a teacher and a trainer of other teachers.  The stories are uniformly well-told and interesting, but the book feels a little more episodic than the first two, both of which have a densely textured feel, as Hughes recounts in loving detail old memories.  This volume is well worth reading, but doesn't quite come up to the same very high standard that the first two do. <br /> <br />Recommended, but do get hold of the first two volumes.	2005-09-04

Very late on one rainy night, Chaz asks his rather drunk wife to join him on the ship's deck. He pretends to drop something, bends over to pick it up, but instead he picks up his wife by the ankles and tosses her overboard. Joey survives the fall thanks to her training as a swimmer, and manages to stay alive in the water, where Mick Stranahan, a former cop now living on a deserted island, eventually finds her hanging on for dear life to a bale of marijuana. Instead of reporting her husband's actions to the police, she decides to get even, with the help of Mick and her brother. <br /> <br />Chaz plays the grieving widower, but the detective in charge of the case isn't buying it. As the story unfolds, the author introduces a full cast of characters, each with their own quirks, from the detective's pet pythons to Chaz's bodyguard Tool, a large, hairy brute that must follow Chaz around, as ordered by his crooked employer. <br /> <br />Many smiles, laughs and a lot of fun await the reader.	2005-09-04

US	53071109	R664IT8N6O48D	1857442830	637587777	Two Knights Defence	Books	5	14	17	N	N	A good introduction to the Two Knights Defence	Suppose you have Black in a chess game and the contest begins with 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6.  Now you are all prepared for Black side of a Ruy Lopez.  But your opponent comes up with 3 Bc4.  What do you play?<br /><br />You could play 3...Be7, as a surprise in case you know the Hungarian Defence much better than your opponent.  And if you have reason to believe that your opponent wants to play, say, a Moeller Attack and not an Evans Gambit, you probably ought to try 3...Bc5.  Otherwise, I think 3...Nf6 is a good choice.  And this book will teach you about it.<br /><br />According to this book, White has three basic moves after 3...Nf6, namely 4 Ng5, 4 d4, and 4 d3. Statistically, none of them are all that good for White.<br /><br />After 4 Ng5, the main line is 4...d5 5 exd5 Na5 6 Bb5+ c6 7 dxc6 bxc6 8 Be2 h6 9 Nf3 e4 10 Ne5 Bd6 11 d4 exd3 12 Nxd3 Bc7 13 b3.  And we see a game in this line, as well as several games in various sidelines.<br /><br />Still, I think the most interesting of the divergences is for Black to play 4...Bc5.  This is the infamous Traxler or Wilkes-Barre Variation, and Pinski gives it a 26-page chapter in this book.  There are also books by Williams, by Estrin, and by Palkovi just on this move, by the way.  It's wild.  Statistically, Black does very well, but of the Grandmasters, Beliavsky is one of the few to play it.<br /><br />I tried the Wilkes-Barre a couple of times.  Here's an example where I won quickly:  1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Nf6 4 Ng5 Bc5 5 Nxf7 (5 Bxf7 is better) 5...Bxf2+ 6 Kxf2 Nxe4+ 7 Ke3 (7 Kg1 is probably better) 7...Qh4 8 Qf3 (8 g3 is much better) 8...Ng5 9 Nxg5 Qxg5+ 10 Kd3 Rf8 11 Qe2 Qf5+ 12 Kc3 e4 (I'm threatening mate!) 13 a3 (rats, he saw it) 13...d5 14 Bb5 d4+ 15 Kb3 Be6+ 16 Ka4 d3! (Winning the Queen, since I'm threatening mate again!) 17 Qe3 (overlooking the mate) 17...Qxb5+ 18 White Resigns.<br /><br />Of course, White does not have to play 4 Ng5.  There are three chapters covering 4 d4 exd4.  White gets nowhere with 5 0-0, so her best chance is 5 e5, but we see that Black is still fine after 5...d5.<br /><br />The final chapter deals with another White alternative, 4 d3.  And with the Black reply 4...Be7.  I do not recommend this line for Black (look over the game where Ivanchuk, with Black, loses to Macieja, and you may agree with me).  I think it is better to play 4...Bc5 and transpose into a Giuoco Pianissimo, which Pinski calls (in his book on the Italian Game and Evans Gambit), \"The Italian Regretted.\"<br /><br />Actually, White can try other moves.  To prove it, I'll give one more game where I won quickly with Black:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Nf6 4 0-0 (this move looks dubious, and it is not mentioned in this book) 4...Nxe4 (4...Bc5 may be better) 5 Re1 (5 Nc3 is better) 5...d5 6 Bb5 Bc5 7 Rf1 Bg4 8 Bxc6+ bxc6 9 d3 Qf6 (moving my Knight might make more sense) 10 dxe4 dxe4 11 h3 Bh5 12 g4 exf3 13 gxh5 (finally winning a piece, but things definitely look black for White) 13...Rd8 14 Qe1 Qf5 15 Qc3 0-0 16 Kh2 e4 17 Rg1 Bd6+ (this forces mate) 18 White Resigns.<br /><br />I recommend this book.e with 5 0-0, so her best chance is 5 e5, but we see that Black is still fine after 5...d5. <br /> <br />The final chapter deals with another White alternative, 4 d3.  And with the Black reply 4...Be7.  I do not recommend this line for Black (look over the game where Ivanchuk, with Black, loses to Macieja, and you may agree with me).

This is an ambitious book that should probably be attempted by only a true fantasy aficionado. Well written with excellent character development, DeVries does (or attempts to do) in one book what would usually be accomplished over the course of a trilogy. As a result we are introduced to a large number of characters, settings, historical narratives and subplots that slow down and get in the way of the main story.<br /><br />Wistrix Donn is a tower of amethyst that has been lost in time, but suddenly reappears at a time when blood feuds have erupted not only between dwarves and humans, but between clans that have been in alliance for centuries.<br /><br />Star-crossed and outcast estranged lovers, Noetic and Ontic were anointed with a mission and a purpose, along with a mystery and a miracle by their god who was murdered. They are recalled from exile because they seem to be the only hope out of chaos.<br /><br />Hordes of black armies appear, supernatural happenings both wonderful and terrible, and flesh-and-blood enemies with supernatural powers and guidance set the stage for the ultimate struggle and heartbreaking choices.	2005-09-04
